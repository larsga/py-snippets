Fruity sugary strawberry-like aroma with mealy grassy notes. Some yeast and herbs, too. Dry-sweetish alcoholic vodka taste with fruity notes. This is what I got initially.

Dried out my mouth. No aftertaste. Just not a good beer. Way too much alcohol taste. &#40;Which, at 5%, takes some doing.

Dry lightly acidic grainy and rubbery taste with grassy peppery notes. Kind of thin body, but strangely that doesn&rsquo;t matter. Dusty, mealy mouthfeel joins up nicely with the grassy peppery taste. Quite harmonic and clean. Hints of lemon. Fades into watery grassy nothing. For 3.5% this is quite good.

59504|Jacobsen Extra|Husbryggeriet Jacobsen (Carlsberg)|5|4|6|3|12|3|Medium coarseish offwhite head. Amber body. Strong harmonic aroma of papery caramel with notes of modelling clay. Dryish kind of sharp papery caramel taste dominates all the way through the aftertaste. Light and mild mouthfeel somewhat obscured by the sharpness of the taste. Minty grassy notes and some fruity straw can be made out. Dry papery caramel aftertaste settles in the mouth, making me want to rinse it. If this were a little less sharp and papery it would be a nice beer. Interestingly, when the beer warms the sharp papery taste becomes less prominent (without disappearing), making the beer more balanced, and citrus notes appear. Becomes more delicate, too. Bitterish aftertaste. (0.75l bottle from Fine Foods at Kastrup airport.)|9/24/2008 9:47:06 AM|Denmark||Valby|Pilsener

Dry-sweet oaked cocoa taste with citric hoppy notes and a minty background. Some alcohol as well. Dry cocoa finish with caramel and sherry notes. The taste is a lot more imperial stout-like.

Intense bitter-sweet coffee taste with alcoholic wild berry notes. Strong alcohol heat starts burning towards the end. Bitter coffee aftertaste. Strange. Where is the complexity? Feels like the bitter alcohol has burned it away, so that other tastes cannot be made out. Needs to mature further. &#40;0.5l bottle, wine monopoly.&#41;  Second rate: Same visuals. Thick coffeeish oily chocolatey aroma with alcoholic toffee and sherry notes. Sweet coffee and chocolate taste with strong alcohol notes. The alcohol taste keeps growing and eventually overpowers the beer entirely. This needs to mature. Will rerate from bottle in November. &#40;0.05l taster draft at EBF &#8217;08.&#41;  First rating: From an unlabeled bottle in June.

Dry rubbery yeasty citric taste with fruity notes. Aftertaste is much the same.

Dry metallic chocolate aftertaste kind of jars with the fruitiness. It&rsquo;s not bad, but I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it much.

61017|Nethergate Umbel Ale (Bottle)|Nethergate|4|4|3|2|6|1.9|Medium offwhite fine-laced head. Pale coppery body with light carbonation. Strange aroma of wet cardboard and sugary citric coriander. Taste is malty coriander with cardboard and orange notes. Some roastiness, too. The aftertaste is the same, and very long. Really disliked this combination. Drain-pour&#033; Later I&rsquo;ve come to suspect that the cider I drank before this may have messed with my palate. Need to rerate.

86387|Somersby Apple Cider|Carlsberg Sverige|5|2|3|2|5|1.7|Big white coarse unstable head quickly disappears entirely. Very pale yellow body with carbonation. Sugary apple aroma, somewhat artificial, but relatively clean. Very sweet artificial apple taste. Palate is sickly sweet. This is just way too sweet. Really a soft drink diluted with apple wine. Yuck. (0.5l can.)|8/16/2008 5:31:05 AM|Sweden||Falkenberg|Cider
91692|Grans Edel Pærecider|Grans Bryggeri|3|2|3|2|4|1.4|Medium coarseish white head quickly disappears entirely. Watery body with faint greenish tinge. Sweet sugary artificial pear aroma with traces of cardamom. The taste is much the same, with a strange metallic off taste, very sweet and artificial, leaves a thick pelt on the teeth. Awful. Basically an insult to the good name of perry. (0.5l can, Rema 1000, Oslo.)|8/14/2008 4:47:00 PM|Norway||Sandefjord|Perry

Dry powerful roasty wooden caramel taste with nutty creosote notes, lightly perfumy. Some fruit and chocolate as well. Soft, clean mouthfeel. Hints of sourness.

Powerful herbal, yeasty aroma with mealy, spicy notes and a fruity citric edge. Peppery floral hops as well. Complex, harmonic, and balanced. Dry herbal, spicy, yeasty taste with fruity citric notes. Dry mealy citric hoppy aftertaste with grapefruit notes. Taste is a bit edgy, mouthfeel is sharp (in bottle, on cask it was soft and smooth), and body mid. One of the better weizens I&rsquo;ve had, since it&rsquo;s not a typical weizen at all. (0.5l bottle, batch #151, ICA Supermarked, Oslo.

Light, soft mouthfeel. Dry-acidic grainy aftertaste. Clean palate, and yet some vaguely disturbing acidic-grainy notes. Obviously the best Grans so far, but still not very good.

Sweetish alcoholic fruity bananaish taste. Thin-bodied with a strange palate. Some acidity. (Hmmmm.) Dryish strawberry alcohol aftertaste. Yuck&#033; This was awful.

The taste also becomes more prominent then.  <p>A subtle, understated beer with considerable charms. I like it!

Wild berry and earthy licorice taste. Dryish chocolatey licorice aftertaste is perhaps the strongest taste. Overall there is surprisingly little taste and depth, though. As you drink, the chocolate comes to dominate more and more. Mild, cool mouthfeel. Not bad, but disappointing for such a strong beer. (0.33l bottle, de Gekraakte Kettel, Amsterdam.

Deep sweet harmonic aroma is a mix of alcohol, wild berries, and licorice, surprisingly light, with earthy, herbal notes. Frist impression is licorice and chocolate, but very thin, followed by soapy, peppery notes. Some herbs and earth, too. There is very little taste, though, and it feels strangely light and thin, and even a bit acidic. Seems like it was most likely lightly infected in the bottle. Should rerate.

Second one had less emphasis on the medicine and more on the resin.) Dry caramelly aftertaste. Good. (0.341l bottle at Bishop&#8217;s Arms, Avenyn, Göteborg. Probably past sell-by date, but can&#8217;t find any date marking on the bottle. Probably on the cap, which the barkeep has. Should rerate.

Faintly dry-and-sweet aftertaste, almost a bit cloying in its sweetness, with grassy hops. Good, but too sweet, and lacking in character. Reminds me a bit of the Norwegian &quot;gold&quot; lagers.

Dry floral hop taste with notes of straw. Hints of residual sweetness. Sharpish mouthfeel. Medium-bodied. Bitter floral hop aftertaste with grain notes.

Dry, sharpish fruity, catty, rubbery aroma with paper and hop notes. I bet some of this is sulphur. Aftertaste is the same, except perhaps slightly more watery.

Acidic vinegar aroma with hints of softly metallic hops and something that might perhaps have become a nice pilsener. Intensely acidic vinegar and vomit taste. As an example of how horribly awful beer can taste this is interesting, but it has no other virtues. You couldn't get drunk on it, because you couldn't drink it. You couldn't use it as roadfill, because the bottles would eventually break. And so on. I did two sips only, but still shudder at the memory. Well. If they get the infection under control this will be a completely different beer, so let's hope they do. (0.5l bottle from the wine monopoly.

Dense chalky fruity taste with citric, yeasty notes, very like the aroma. Sharpish, powdery mouthfeel. Something vaguely herbal in there, too. Somewhat dry. Spicy, chalky, wheaty aftertaste.

Sweetish smoky burnt licorice aroma with chocolate notes. Dry, burnt softly metallic sooty aftertaste. A decent stout, but like many English stouts it's too watery and burnt.

16872|Robinsons Old Tom (Bottle)|Robinsons|5|5|5|3|12|3|Big beige head. Deep dark red body. Soft, sweetish licorice aroma, very faint. Very sweet, rounded, milky toffee taste with notes of pepper, tobacco, and licorice. Some alcohol heat is noticeable. Bitter tobacco aftertaste. It's OK, but should have had much more flavour than this. A bit disappointing. (0.33l bottle from Alko.)|7/14/2007 2:45:59 PM|England|Greater Manchester|Stockport|Old Ale
46471|Ridgeway IPA|Ridgeway|6|4|6|3|12|3.1|Huge white head. Slightly hazy orange body. Sweetish wooden hoppy aroma with notes of citrus and resin. Aroma is quite light and mild. Dry tobaccoish smoky citric hoppy taste with floral notes. No aftertaste, but a bitter, metallic taste lingers. It's OK, but not too good. May be that it suffered in storage here at home.

51251|Krune Sider (Crown Cider)|Kalfarets Kultur|6|3|4|1|4|1.8|Big white head collapses in a matter of seconds, leaving just a thin white ring. Pale yellow body. Aroma of apple, alcohol, and fennel. Taste is intense alcoholic apple and fennel, very thin and harsh. No real aftertaste, just a kind of emptiness. Did not like this at all. Had a few sips to do the rating, then poured out the rest.

71077|Nøgne Ø Dark Horizon First Edition|Nøgne Ø|8|4|8|5|18|4.3|Small dark brown head doesn&#8217;t last, but shrinks into a thin ring. Opaque black body goes dark brown at edges. Intense sweet toffeeish chocolate liquor aroma with notes of coffee, bread, and ripe fruit. Very harmonic and balanced, despite the clear alcohol presence.Deep, intense sweet chocolate and toffee taste with licorice and alcohol notes. Bready, yeasty presence, too. Very harmonic. Mouthfeel is initially thick and oily, then goes intensely warm from the alcohol. Also a kind of muddy, coarse feel to it. No real aftertaste, but bitter orange-peel and chocolate taste lingers. The beer is still a bit sharp and edgy; I imagine it&#8217;s likely to mellow and improve a lot with age. It feels a bit too powerful in the first couple of sips, but then settles into a sweet chocolatey toffee character, which is intensely pleasurable. A pity I had to share this with my girlfriend; would have preferred to drink it all myself. :-) Fantastic! A king among beers, indeed.

Strong tropical fruity hop aroma with chocolatey, roasty malty background. Sharpish dry fruity hop taste with the same roasty malt background. Body is a bit thin and watery, perhaps unavoidable with only 4.5% alcohol, but leaves the hops a bit high and dry--that is, unbalanced. Dry, smoky burnt malt aftertaste. Very nice! One of the best beers you can buy in Norwegian shops (outside the wine monopoly). (0.5l bottle from Ica Gourmet, Aker Brygge, Oslo. Batch #99, oct '07.

Some light roastiness as well. The trademark chalky bitterness is also present. Sugary, broad mouthfeel. Dry roasted aftertaste. Smoky notes settle in as you drink.

1384|Svyturys Baltijos DarkRed|Svyturys (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg)|4|5|6|3|10|2.8|Huge yellowish offwhite head, partly coarse. Beautiful amber body with fast carbonation. Aroma is a subtle, harmonic mix of butter, roastiness, rubber, and milk. Taste is sweet, roasty rubber malts. Aftertaste is dry butter. It&#8217;s quite well made, but they decided to put in some stuff I don&#8217;t like, notably butter and rubber. Overall score is pretty low, because of that.

44253|Oakleaf I Cant Believe Its Not Bitter   |Oakleaf|6|3|6|3|12|3|Huge coarse-laced white head over light copper body with some carbonation. Fruity, resiny aroma with hoppy notes. Sharpish, peppery resiny taste with lemony, fruity, wooden notes. Bitter, wooden aftertaste. Interesting, and drinkable, but quite sharp, without too much pleasant stuff to make up for it. Does indeed not taste like a typical lager, but neither does it taste like a normal bitter. (0.5l bottle.)|3/25/2007 3:05:07 PM|England|Hampshire|Gosport|Zwickel/Keller/Landbier
742|Corona Extra|Grupo Modelo (Corona)|5|3|3|2|3|1.6|Biggish offwhite shiny head quickly shrinks. Pale yellow body with some carbonation. Light, rubbery aroma.

70663|Atna Hjemmepåske-øl|Atna Bryggeri|6|4|7|3|14|3.4|Medium light beige head. Deep red body with ongoing carbonation. Light rubbery aroma with delicate roasted almond notes. Taste is deep burnt malts with coffee notes, soot, and a touch of watery toffee. Dry, sooty aftertaste. Slightly watery, probably because they made it at 4.7%. Not bad, but a bit thin and one-dimensional. Could be more exciting. (0.33l bottle. Thanks to gr0ve!)|3/25/2007 2:08:30 PM|Norway||Atna|Brown Ale
9264|Ottakringer Helles|Ottakringer|6|3|7|3|14|3.3|Biggish shiny white head. Yellow body with some carbonation and small particles. Sweetish earthy aroma of malts, apples, perfume, and some rubber. Sweetish earthy-bitter taste of light malts, yeast, and metallic rubber, with a touch of peas. Much better than the description makes it sound. Dry, floral aftertaste. A good helles.

60939|Dark Star Espresso Stout (Keg & Bottle)|Dark Star|7|4|6|3|15|3.5|Small dark brown head with a rash of larger bubbles. Deep dark red body, only just transparent. Dense, earthy, complex coffee aroma. Dry, bitter coffee taste, somewhat thin-bodied. In fact, it tastes like a slightly watery espresso. The coffee taste is quite complex, but drowns out anything else that might be present. Aftertaste is the same. A very interesting beer, but perhaps a bit one-dimensional. I'd like it more if it were sweeter and offered more than just coffee. Still, getting this much taste into a 4.2% beer is quite impressive.

4728|Anchor Old Foghorn Ale|Anchor Brewing Company|7|3|6|3|15|3.4|Small tan head. Hazy reddish brown body. Sweet, dense, firm aroma of tropical fruit and roasty malts with notes of perfume, spice, and chocolate. Very complex, yet harmonic aroma. Intense spicy taste of fruits, roasted malts, and alcohol. Very bitter. Slightly oily mouthfeel, and lots of alcohol warmth. Dry, burnt, spicy aftertaste. The alcohol and bitterness dominate a bit too much, unfortunately.

145|Youngs Old Nick|Wells & Youngs|7|4|7|4|16|3.8|Huge light beige head. Slightly hazy dark brown body. Light, complex aroma of dried fruit, licorice, and malts with a touch of chocolate. Taste is a deep and complex mix of dried plums, chocolate, licorice, and spice. Light-bodied and balanced despite the complexity. Dry, licorice and cocos aftertaste. A truly excellent beer!

70475|Berentsens Økologisk Pils|Berentsens Brygghus|4|3|4|2|7|2|Small white head with some larger bubbles. Yellow body with some carbonation. Light rubbery aroma. Some people like sulphur in their pilsener; I don't. Taste is grainy rubber with notes of chalk and resin. Somewhat acidic. Vague, faint burnt caramel flavour as well. Dryish grainy aftertaste. Bitter chalky taste settles in the mouth. Sharp and not really very pleasant. (0.33l bottle.) |3/14/2007 2:09:22 PM|Norway||Egersund|Bohemian Pilsener
54696|Cwmbran Plum Porter|Cwmbran|5|5|7|3|14|3.4|Small beige head. Deep dark red translucent body. Weak, earthy aroma of a mix of tropical fruit and tobacco. Taste is deep, sweetish burnt malts with fruit, earth, and tobacco notes. Some dense dark chocolate as well. Aftertaste is dry tobacco, and lingers. Slightly watery, but this isn't so strange, given the low alcohol content. It's not bad, but could be better. (0.5l bottle.)|3/14/2007 2:08:34 PM|Wales||Cwmbran|Porter
70843|Ølve Festivalbokk|Ølve på Egge Bryggeri|7|3|7|2|15|3.4|Head is just a thin white ring. Hazy orange body. Sweetish lightly roasted aroma with notes of peas and hops. Taste is acidic roasty malts with a strong grassy hop profile. A bit thin and watery mouthfeel, partly because of the low carbonation. Aftertaste just kind of fades. A very good beer, even it's not very bock-like. (0.5l bottle.)|3/11/2007 1:17:15 PM|Norway||Steinkjer|Traditional Ale

Sweet roasted caramel and burnt almonds taste with alcohol and metallic buttery earth notes. Full-bodied. Oily mouthfeel. Very harmonic. Bittersweet metallic roasty grassy aftertaste. Quite subtle, but different, and interesting. Very good&#033; &#40;0.33l bottle. Rated twice.&#41;|3/11/2007 7:48:02 AM|Germany|Lower Saxony|Einbeck|Dunkler Bock

Sweet earthy roasty caramel taste with notes of burnt almonds. Dry straw and grain aftertaste. A good bock, but not as good as the helles. Less of the signature Einbecker flavour.

1589|Coopers Sparkling Ale|Coopers Brewery|6|2|6|3|14|3.1|Biggish coarseish offwhite head. Orange body with yeast floaties. Faintly spicy malt aroma. Taste is bitterish malts with notes of straw and wood with a touch of spice. Dry wooden aftertaste. Has a tart, medicinal quality to it. Very unusual taste, but would probably grow on me if I could find this again. Wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if the recipe and brewing methods are quite old. Quite good. (0.375l bottle.

19049|Kopparbergs Pear Cider|Kopparbergs Bryggeri|3|2|3|1|3|1.2|Small grayish head quickly disappears entirely. Body looks like water with a splash of pear juice in it. Seems all Swedish ciders look exactly the same. Intensely artificial aroma of something that's probably meant to be pear. Sweet, sugary pear taste, completely free of complexity. Aftertaste is artificial pear bubble gum, settling down into a lingering watery unpleasant pear-like taste. Didn't like this one, either. (0.5l can.)|3/8/2007 2:58:55 PM|Sweden||Kopparberg|Perry
23940|Kopparbergs Apple Cider|Kopparbergs Bryggeri|4|2|3|1|4|1.4|Small grayish head quickly disappears entirely. Body looks like water with a splash of apple juice in it. Visually I'd be unable to tell this and the two Halmstad ciders apart. Sugary artificial apple and bubble gum aroma. No complexity at all. Disgusting thin, sugary artificial apple taste with notes of paper. Settles into a sweet bubblegum and metal aftertaste. This is awful. Man, sometimes you have to suffer for these ratings.

In fact, it's visually identical with its apple cousin. Sweet, artificial powdery pear aroma. No complexity at all. Taste is thin, sweet pear, rather artificial. Somewhat watery. Aftertaste is artificially acidic, tastes of chemicals. Sugary. Drinkable, but unpleasant. (0.5l can.)|3/8/2007 2:43:34 PM|Sweden||Halmstad|Perry
1164|Halmstad Cider Äpple|Krönleins Bryggeri|5|2|4|1|6|1.8|Small grayish head quickly disappears entirely. Body looks like water with a splash of apple juice in it. Aroma is sweet apples, a bit artificial. Very straightforward. Taste is again sweet apples, somewhat artificial, and a bit watery. Aftertaste is sugary and artificial. Sugary taste lingers in the mouth. Drinkable, but way too sweet and artificial. (0.5l can.)|3/8/2007 2:29:36 PM|Sweden||Halmstad|Cider
1083|Heather Ales Fraoch (Bottle)|Williams Brothers (Heather Ales)|7|4|7|3|14|3.5|Medium shiny offwhite head. Bronze body. Strange sweetish aroma of unidentifiable herbs, probably heather.

Taste is banana and licorice with yeasty notes. Dry, softly metallic hop aftertaste. Some tobacco and pea notes linger. A good trippel, but not one of the best.

23846|Refsvindinge Mors Stout|Refsvindinge Bryggeri|6|4|6|3|11|3|Throws a huge darkish brown head. Opaque black body goes deep dark red at edges. Mild milky, dry burnt aroma with faint earthy notes. Taste is sweetish milky chocolate with some burntness and light wooden notes. A bit watery, but mouthfeel is still somewhat oily. Dry, thin burnt aftertaste with some acidity. Decent, but very boring, and too watery. (0.33l bottle.)|3/7/2007 3:09:27 PM|Denmark||Refsvindinge|Sweet Stout
10907|Oud Beersel Oude Geuze|Brouwerij Oud Beersel|7|4|8|4|16|3.9|Thin offwhite head. Hazy yellow body with vigourous carbonation. Hoppy metallic wooden barnyard aroma with tropical fruity notes. Dry-sour barnyard wooden grainy lemony taste with metallic peppery fruity notes. Thin, sharpish mouthfeel. Dry lemony wooden aftertaste with mineraly winter apple and wax notes. Faint barnyard throughout. Amazing harmony, even if the beer in some respects sharp and harsh.. &#40;0.355l bottle from Ole R. Original rating from an old bottle bought in Cambridge. Rated a third time from wine monopoly, then a fourth.&#41;|3/7/2007 2:55:38 PM|Belgium||Beersel|Lambic - Gueuze

Sweetish bready aroma, quite light, with notes of licorice and milk. Carbonates on the tongue. Light, faintly roasty taste with light fruitiness and a touch of spice. Dry, slightly roasty aftertaste. Thinnish. Well. This is OK, but pretty boring. Like a very watery and boring Belgian dubbel. (0.33l bottle.)|3/6/2007 4:25:10 PM|Denmark||Refsvindinge|Brown Ale

Light sweetish earthy licorice aroma with roasty smoky notes. Thinnish burnt earthy smoky licorice taste with dryish burnt aftertaste. Strange, almost meaty notes in the background. Something faintly oily in the mouthfeel. Very unusual, and not bad, but not too great, either. May have been stored too long. (0.33l bottle.)|3/6/2007 3:17:57 PM|Denmark||Refsvindinge|Smoked

Light rubbery malt taste with mealy apple notes and some paper. Chalky notes. Dry, rubbery aftertaste. Typical eastern European lager, but not the best.

9193|Courage Russian Imperial Stout|John Smiths (Heineken UK)|8|4|8|3|17|4|No head to speak of. Opaque black body. Deep plum, sherry, and wild berries aroma. Taste is very similar. Complex and hard to describe, but in excellent condition. Amazing that it's held up so well for so many years. (0.33l bottle. 1983 vintage.

23208|Westons Oak Conditioned Medium Sweet Cider|Westons Cider|7|2|6|3|11|2.9|Small white head quickly disappears. Pale yellow body with carbonation. Acidic earthy metallic aroma with wooden notes, not unlike a mild lambik. Dry, earthy metallic taste with notes of something rather like aged blue cheese. Somewhat watery. Dry, cheesy taste lingers. Interesting and drinkable, but not sure I like it. At least it's not like Norwegian industrial &quot;cider&quot;, which is just a soft drink with some apple in it.

Deep aroma of tropical fruit and soft metal, as well as notes of wet paper and honey. Light papery tropical fruit taste, slightly acidic. Dry soft metal and water aftertaste with spice notes. Not bad, but some flaws, and a bit boring. (0.4l on tap at de Groote Witte Arend in Antwerp, where it was billed as &quot;de Arend Blond&quot;.

Chalky, earthy caramel aroma with notes of peas, straw, and rubber. Sweetish chalky straw and caramel taste with a soft mouthfeel. Notes of peas and earth. Dry earthy aftertaste with floral hop notes. Quite a lot of taste. A very good pilsener, and very unusual, although it definitely has the house profile.

2205|Westmalle Dubbel|Brouwerij der Trappisten van Westmalle|7|4|8|3|17|3.9|Biggish beige head. Black opaque body, as far as I can tell. Sweet banana aroma with notes of licorice, spice, and soft metallic hops. Deep, intensely spicy (paradise seeds, coriander, pepper, and cinnamon), licorice, and chocolate taste with strong banana notes. Aftertaste is chocolatey spice, quite bitter. Harmonic. A fantastic beer, one of the best Belgians. (0.33l bottle.)|2/25/2007 5:15:34 AM|Belgium||Malle|Abbey Dubbel
69263|Waldemars Stout|Waldemars Mikrobryggeri (Hansa Borg)|7|4|6|3|13|3.3|Medium beige head. Deep dark red body, barely translucent. Burnt chocolatey aroma with notes of soot and a hint of hops. Taste is clean, clear burntness with a pretty thin body, but this time not so much that it's a problem. Aftertaste is bitterish hops and burntness. Feels a bit acidic, but it's probably bitterness. A bit watery. They should allow themselves to go above 4.5%; that would have improved all of these beers. (0.5l draft.)|2/24/2007 7:22:15 AM|Norway||Bergen|Stout
69260|Waldemars Hveteøl|Waldemars Mikrobryggeri (Hansa Borg)|6|3|5|2|10|2.6|Tiny white head. Hazy yellow body with carbonation. Sweetish fruity aroma with milky, yeasty notes, and peachy hops. Taste is dominated by peachy hops (in a weizen?!?) and very thin and watery otherwise. Dry throughout. Dry, peachy, chalky aftertaste. Salty. Thin hoppy taste lingers. I really like the hops, but this isn't even remotely like the German weizen it's advertised as. Mouthfeel is a real letdown. Could have made a nice APA session beer, though.

69262|Waldemars Pilsner|Waldemars Mikrobryggeri (Hansa Borg)|6|3|5|3|12|2.9|Medium shiny creamy white head. Orangeish yellow slightly hazy body with light carbonation. Light harmonic aroma that blends grassy hops, apples, and some rubber. Soft, spicy grass hop taste with a dryish edge. Aftertaste is chalky rubbery paper. Some chewiness. Could use more aroma hops and less rubber, but probably appeals to the locals. Lacks the signature metallic bitterness generally associated with Hansa. It's not too bad, but I didn't like the aftertaste too much. (0.5l draft.)|2/24/2007 7:13:37 AM|Norway||Bergen|Pilsener

Taste is soft mild milky grain with a touch of chalk and grass. No aftertaste. It's unoffensive, but there's no reason to drink this other than to get drunk, and there are better ways of achieving that.

405|Miller Genuine Draft (MGD)|Miller Brewing Company (MillerCoors)|5|3|3|1|5|1.7|Medium offwhite shiny head over light copper body. Sweetish sugary corn aroma with marzipan notes. Taste is strangely empty caramel with a buttery mouthfeel. Watery, unpleasantly artificial roasty aftertaste. Buttery taste lingers in the mouth. It didn't smell too bad, but the taste is unpleasant. It's a slick commercial product, with the unpleasant off taste that seems to go with that. (0.33l bottle.)|2/23/2007 12:05:08 PM|United States|Wisconsin|Milwaukee|Pale Lager

Sweet alcoholic licorice aroma with chocolate notes, slightly unbalanced. Deep sweet bitterish cinnamon and licorice taste, again somewhat off balance. Dry spicy fruity aftertaste. Alcohol heat, and some taste as well. Quite nice, but far from perfect. (0.33l bottle at 't Waagstuk, Antwerp.

Dry-sweet herbal blueberry and cardamom taste with papery notes. Mid-bodied.  Fizzy mouthfeel.  Dry-bitter blueberry and cardamom aftertaste is a bit harsh, with herbal mealy papery coriander notes.

A bit too faint for a 6, but not bad. Mild malty taste with some apple and a bitterish edge. Chalky, bitterish aftertaste, slightly metallic. Think I can make out some aroma hop, but not sure.

Taste is bitterish milky rubber with a bitter, metallic aftertaste. Seems to be pretty generously hopped, but with bitter hops only, in the usual Ringnes style. The burnt malts mentioned on the can must be for colour only. This isn't the worst Munkholm, but it has little other than an absence of the worst off flavours to recommend it.

BB was March 2007.)|12/30/2006 7:59:28 AM|Norway||Heggenes|Brown Ale
11030|Fantôme Hiver (Winter)|Brasserie Fantôme|7|4|6|3|14|3.4|Medium fine-laced white head. Orange body with slight haze. Very harmonic aroma--hard to analyze. Tropical fruit, tobacco, and subtle, light dusty balanced spices. Orange, wood, and pepper. Taste is milky acidic tobacco with tropical fruit notes and chalk. Bitter dandelion aftertaste. Not bad, but it's possible the bottle was too old. Should re-rate to be sure. (0.75l bottle.)|12/30/2006 7:44:18 AM|Belgium||Soy-Erezée|Saison
24383|3 Fonteinen Schaerbeekse Kriek|3 Fonteinen|7|4|6|3|13|3.3|Thin white head disappears quickly, leaving just a thin white ring. Hazy ruby red body. Sour, metallic, mealy lambic aroma with faint cherry background. Taste is again sour, dry metal with a sharp powdery mouthfeel. Extremely thin-bodied. Just hints of cherry, mainly in the aftertaste. A challenging beer to drink, and interesting, but a bit disappointing as a kriek. Seems to me it makes little difference that the cherries were grown in Schaerbeek when you can hardly taste them anyway.

10733|Schöfferhofer Hefeweizen|Binding-Brauerei (Oetker Group)|6|3|6|3|12|3|Largish white head. Hazy milky yellow body. Light citric mealy banana aroma. Chalky, milky citric banana taste that goes slightly bitter at the end. Dryish. A decent weizen; more bitter than usual.

138|Youngs Lords Beer|Youngs|6|3|5|3|10|2.7|Small white head. Amber body with a slight haze. Mild nutty hop aroma with something funny in the background kind of like gasoline (may be because the beer is 9 months past the sell-by date). Taste is watery chalky paper and bitterness. It must be too old, so I'm rating it a bit leniently, given that I'll probably never be able to re-rate. This probably was a nice bitter when they bottled it.

17313|CB Magnum Mørk|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|6|3|5|2|8|2.4|Medium offwhite fine-laced head. Darkish red-brown body. Sweetish dusty caramel and cinnamon aroma with earthy notes. Earthy cinnamon taste with roasty notes. Bitterish throughout. Bitter, metallic aftertaste. Thin-bodied. Not too well balanced, but drinkable.

24693|Bryggerimesteren Gull Pils|Berentsens Brygghus|5|3|3|3|4|1.8|Medium white fine-laced head. Greenish yellow body. Peppery hop aroma with rubber notes and some light malts. Taste is light, clean grass, faintly sweetish, with bitter, papery aftertaste. The bitter, papery taste lingers unpleasantly. An OK pilsener, but spoiled by that aftertaste. (1.5l plastic bottle.)|12/30/2006 7:26:51 AM|Norway||Egersund|Pilsener
12172|Val-Dieu Bière de Noël|Brasserie de l'Abbaye du Val-Dieu|5|4|3|2|3|1.7|Medium light beige head over hazy reddish brown body. Light rubbery aroma. Taste is acidic tobacco with notes of paper and chalk. This is useless. I wonder if my bottle was off, given how highly others have rated this beer. I should find another and rerate. (0.33l bottle.)|12/28/2006 2:23:48 PM|Belgium||Aubel|Belgian Strong Ale
11336|Malheur 10|Brouwerij Malheur (formerly De Landtsheer)|7|3|7|3|16|3.6|Small white head. Faintly hazy yellow body. Firm, harmonic sweetish aroma of tropical fruit with soft marzipan notes and a touch of alcohol. Taste is deep, sweet marzipan (and possibly chocolate) with notes of hops and something reminiscent of tobacco. Very smooth and harmonic, and quite bitter. Bitter, chalky aftertaste with strong hop notes. Very nice! (0.33l bottle.)|12/28/2006 1:52:13 PM|Belgium||Buggenhout|Belgian Strong Ale
10312|t Smisje Wostyntje|Brouwerij Smisje|6|3|2|2|3|1.6|Tiny white head. Deep copper body. Complex, smoky aroma of alcohol, tobacco, and tropical fruit with notes of peas. Taste is intensely acidic tobacco with lemony aftertaste. Reminiscent of tobacoo lambic. This is awful. I'm not sure if that's because making beer from mustard is just plain dumb, or whether it's because the bottle is too old. I should get another one and re-rate.

994|Corsendonk Pater / Abbey Brown Ale|Brouwerij Corsendonk|6|4|7|3|14|3.4|Huge offwhite coarse head. Dark red body that's kind of opaque, possibly because it's hazy. Harmonic vinuous licorice aroma with spicy, yeasty notes. Deep, harmonic, bitter licorice taste with chocolate notes and a touch of bread. Dry, almost floral aftertaste. Relatively straightforward and a bit watery. Good, and drinkable, but nothing major. (0.75l bottle.)|12/27/2006 4:31:34 PM|Belgium||Turnhout|Abbey Dubbel
68039|5.0 Original Weizen|Brauerei Braunschweig / Feldschlößchen (Oettinger)|6|3|6|3|12|3|Big white head; hazy orange body. Acidic, wheaty, peppery aroma with light citric notes. Taste is citric, milky wheat with yeasty, dusty notes. Dusty, powdery mouthfeel. Faintly dry aftertaste. Some spice as well. A decent weizen, but nothing special.

10050|Achel 8 Blond|Brouwerij der Trappistenabdij De Achelse Kluis|7|4|7|4|16|3.8|Enormous offwhite head over orange body. Delicate aroma of stale hops, metal, and tropical fruit. Taste is powerful tropical fruit overlaid with metallic, stale hops and spice. Dry, astringent spice aftertaste. Very difficult to characterize, and quite complex. Very unusual, but nice, with lots of character. (0.33l bottle.)|12/27/2006 3:12:14 PM|Belgium||Hamont-Achel|Belgian Strong Ale
5205|Kasteelbier Donker|Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck|7|4|8|3|16|3.8|Small light beige head. Dark red translucent body. Tight vinuous peppery aroma of licorice and alcohol with notes of chocolate. Quite harmonic. Taste is deep, sweet licorice and chocolate, with strong spicy notes, and a cardamom finish. Very harmonic, and hard to analyze, but very, very nice. Quite a bit of alcohol heat, and you can taste a little alcohol as well. (0.33l bottle.)|12/27/2006 2:13:05 PM|Belgium||Ingelmunster|Belgian Strong Ale
11852|Mallaskosken Tumma Kuohu IV|Mallaskoski|6|4|6|3|10|2.9|Big coarse beige head. Dark red translucent body with ongoing carbonation. Peppery caramelly aroma with notes of milk and paper. Taste is powerful acidic smoky caramel with a bitter grassy aftertaste. Smoky taste lingers. Slightly sickly metallic-like off-taste, with notes of wild berries. Quite a bit of taste, but somehow it doesn't appeal very much. Could be the acidity. (0.5l can.)|12/27/2006 1:18:05 PM|Finland||Seinajoki|Dunkel
14929|Mack Arctic Ice|Mack Bryggeri|5|2|5|3|9|2.4|Big white head shrinks quickly. Pale yellow body. Very light marzipany aroma, otherwise nothing. Taste is pretty much the same; only just detectable. Some slight acidity as well, and perhaps traces of hops. As an ice beer, this is quite successful: there's hardly any taste, and no off tastes. As a beer, it's dreadfully boring. Choose something else. (0.5l can. Labelled Mack Ice.)|12/22/2006 4:38:41 PM|Norway||Tromsø|Pale Lager
18174|Svaneke Julebryg|Svaneke Bryghus|6|3|6|3|12|3|Small white head quickly disappears. Dark reddish brown body. Yeasty, hoppy aroma reminiscent of peas with faint smoky notes. Taste is dominated by the same yeasty, hoppy, pea-like flavour with some smoke in it, and perhaps some chocolate notes at the far back. Dry, grassy aftertaste. Very unusual taste, but not bad. (0.5l bottle.)|12/22/2006 4:01:40 PM|Denmark||Svaneke|Dunkel
18375|Gouden Carolus Noël (Christmas)|Brouwerij Het Anker|7|4|8|4|16|3.9|Biggish offwhite head over dark red body. Deep, sharpish banana aroma with notes of licorice and spice, and, very faintly, traces of alcohol. Taste is again a deep, sharpish, harmonic mix of banana and licorice with bread, yeast, and peppery spice notes. Very complex. Smooth mouthfeel. Dry, peppery licorice aftertaste with yeast notes. Quite a bit of alcohol heat. (0.33l bottle.)|12/22/2006 2:43:47 PM|Belgium||Mechelen|Belgian Strong Ale
37521|Mack Mørketids-Øl|Mack Bryggeri|6|3|5|3|11|2.8|Big white head with holes from larger bubbles. Copper body. Clean, sweetish malty aroma with caramel notes and resiny hop background. Taste is a bit hoppy initially, then soft caramel malts make their entrance, before the hops take over again, and bring up a dry, grassy rear. Soft, smooth mouthfeel. A decent industrial lager. (0.5l can.)|12/22/2006 2:04:24 PM|Norway||Tromsø|Vienna
3949|Mythos|Mythos Breweries (Carlsberg)|5|1|2|2|2|1.2|Huge white coarse head collapses quickly, leaving a thin white film (with white lumpy-looking islands of denser foam) over a yellow body. Faintly malty aroma with slight grassy notes. Taste is thin, acidic caramel with a buttery, metallic aftertaste. Some dryness lingers, together with a foul bitter rubbery taste. Yuck! This is really crap. Replacing this with Stella and Tiger would be a real step forward. (0.33l can. Thanks to Knut Albert for the can!)|12/21/2006 4:10:05 PM|Greece||Sindos|Pale Lager
729|Sapporo Draft Beer / Premium Beer|Sapporo Breweries|5|3|6|3|11|2.8|Small white head; copper body with a little bit of carbonation. Clean, slightly acidic aroma with notes of apple. Taste is light and clean, mostly caramel and marzipan with apple notes and a touch of grass. Slightly dry grassy and faintly metallic aftertaste. Light and refreshing to drink. A perfectly decent lager. (0.33l bottle.)|12/20/2006 2:39:12 PM|Japan||Tokyo|Pale Lager

Sweet, harmonic spicy banana licorice taste with cinnamon notes. Bitter licorice finish. Dry licorice taste lingers. Very good! Complex and powerful, but still easily drinkable.

1434|Duvel|Duvel Moortgat|7|4|7|4|15|3.7|Huge creamy white lasting head. Pale yellow body with very light haze. Light sweetish peppery hop aroma with a sharpish edge that's probably the alcohol, with light fruity notes. Acidic, soft malty taste with soft metallic edge and light stale hop notes. Delicate, dryish marzipan finish. Very good, but doesn't really taste that much. (0.33l bottle.)|12/16/2006 4:05:41 PM|Belgium||Breendonk-Puurs|Belgian Strong Ale

Subtle, sweetish light peppery metal hop aroma with spice notes with notes of pine needles and stale hops. Sourish intense bitter taste of resin, pine needles, and citrus with dry, citric finish.

Dark red, translucent body, rather like red wine. Sweetish, faintly earthy, milky caramel aroma with lightly grassy hop aroma. Harmonic. Sweet chocolatey licorice taste with milky cinnamon notes. Bitterish aftertaste with grassy notes. Extremely smooth, but a bit cloying. Quite nice. (0.5l bottle.)|12/15/2006 1:48:47 PM|Lithuania||Utena|Baltic Porter

Taste is light rubber with faint notes of apple and malts and a thin, sourish faintly salty aftertaste. Interesting. This is a definite drain-pour, even though the beer hardly tastes anything at all.

40466|Authentique Blonde|Authentique Brasserie|6|3|5|3|11|2.8|Medium white head; clear yellow body with a little carbonation. Deep fruity spicy aroma with tobacco and salt notes.

1039|Delirium Tremens|Brouwerij Huyghe|7|3|6|3|13|3.2|Small white head; hazy yellow body with yeast floaties. Aroma of apple, alcohol, licorice and peppery hops with notes of cough juice. Taste is again licorice, apple, cough jouce, and metallic hop notes. Bitter marzipan aftertaste. Pretty light overall. Quite good, but a bit too bitter and medicinal for me, with not enough to offer to make up for it. (0.33l bottle.)|12/13/2006 1:27:37 PM|Belgium||Melle|Belgian Strong Ale
2469|Erdinger Dunkel|Erdinger Weissbräu|5|4|6|3|12|3|Big beige creamy lasting head, black opaque body. Faint acidic wheaty aroma with earthy licorice notes.

132|Newcastle Brown Ale|John Smiths (Heineken UK)|6|4|5|3|11|2.9|Smallish offwhite head quickly disappears. Dark red barely translucent body. Light licorice and caramel aroma with faintly roasty notes and some fruitiness. Fruity, dry taste of roasty caramel and tobacco. Not too fond of the taste, I have to admit.

5407|Einbecker Dunkel|Einbecker Brauhaus|7|4|6|3|13|3.3|Small coarse beige head; dark reddish brown body. Sweet licorice aroma with notes of dried plums and cherries. Taste is earthy plums and licorice with an unexpectedly dry tobacco aftertaste. Quite nice, but too thin and dry in the taste to really appeal.

Light bitterish hoppy aroma of caramel with citric tea and traces of nuts. Taste is lightish nutty caramel with a dry aftertaste of roasted almonds. Wooden notes.

9351|Blaugies La Moneuse|Brasserie de Blaugies|6|3|5|2|11|2.7|Small coarse white head. Light copper body with carbonation. Complex sweetish aroma of tropical fruit, champagne, and cake. Bitter champagne flavour. Initially there is extreme carbonation in the mouth, which makes it hard to analyze it in any detail, but gradually this settles down. Metal, grain, marzipan, and fruit. Quite a bit of alcohol heat. A bit thin-bodied and harsh for me. (0.375l bottle. Quite old, with yeast particles in the bottle; should probably re-rate at some point. Only rating beer from the top part of the bottle. Had a real struggle opening the wire cage; in the end the wire just broke. They could market this as a negative-calorie beer.)|12/9/2006 1:03:35 PM|Belgium||Dour-Blaugies|Saison

Acidic apple-and-malts aroma with a whiff of rubber. Bitterish apple-and-grain taste with a touch of chalk. A nice floral hop profile shows up briefly before being submerged in a bitter dandelion finish. Has nice points, but is too bitter for such a thin-bodied beer.

Sweet powerful licorice and caramel taste with alcohol notes. Dry oily caramel finish. A good bit of alcohol heat. Burnt almond taste lingers. Nice, but very unusual for an English beer.

Light clean sweetish caramel and marzipan aroma with apple notes. Taste is sweetish apple and grain with faintly dry and chalky aftertaste.

Light caramelly aroma with a touch of perfume. Taste is sweet caramel with cinnamon notes. Softly dry aftertaste with peppery notes. Slightly papery licorice taste lingers.

51332|North Coast Le Merle|North Coast Brewing Company|6|4|6|3|14|3.3|Big shiny offwhite lasting head over hazy yellow body with lots of carbonation.

Soft, extremely smooth taste of licorice, burnt malts, and coffee, with some acidity and faint marzipan notes as well as wild berries again. Burnt, chocolatey aftertaste, slightly dry. Fantastic!

Soft caramelly malt aroma with notes of cinnamon and, very faintly, pine needles. Taste is watery roasty caramel with soft pine needle hops and some acidity. Aftertaste is roastiness with some hints of cardboard at the end. A peppery dryness in the mouth lingers. This is a bit thin, but definitely decent, despite the silly marketing.

Taste is again spicy, clean, wheat malts with some citric acidity. Aftertaste is dry, slightly papery, wheat malts and pepper, and, in the background, a good dose of hops. This is a good beer, and without the paper it would really be something. (0.33l bottle.)|11/13/2006 4:06:26 PM|Norway||Drammen|Dunkelweizen
5402|Einbecker Ur-Bock Hell|Einbecker Brauhaus|7|3|7|4|15|3.6|Head is just thin white film; body greenish yellow with faint carbonation. Dense caramelly earthy malt aroma with some hops. Taste is deep, hoppy malts with notes of straw, grain, and earth. Smooth, faintly oily mouthfeel. Dry, earthy aftertaste. Quite unusual, but once you acquire a taste for it, it&#8217;s nice.

Is something wrong with this bottle? Bitter, unbalanced taste of roasty grain and faint wine. Bitter taste lingers. Didn&#8217;t really enjoy this. (0.33l bottle.)  <p><b>Update:</b> It seems clear now that Lervig has been having quality problems.

Sweet roasty caramel taste with alcoholic, buttery notes. Somewhat watery. Bitter aftertaste. Not easy to say why, but I didn&#8217;t enjoy this too much. It has a bit of taste, but it&#8217;s somewhat unbalanced, and a bit too bitter. Could also do without the butter. (0.33l bottle.)|11/11/2006 2:40:20 PM|Norway||Oslo|Dunkler Bock
16847|Lundetangen Juleøl |Aass Bryggeri|5|5|6|3|12|3.1|Huge light beige fine-laced head over beautiful dark red body. Light aroma of caramel, roasty malts, and rubber.

36556|Oslo India Pale Ale|Oslo Mikrobryggeri|6|4|6|3|14|3.3|Big off-white creamy lasting head, rather like an ice cream. Deep yellow faintly hazy body. Light resiny, fruity, floral aroma. Taste is again light golden malts with an even lighter resiny hop profile. A pity; the previous version of this beer was really great. Resiny, floral, bitter aftertaste, with a dusty malt feel to it. A bit too thin-bodied. A good, drinkable IPA, but could have a lot more aroma and sharpness to it. Served too cold. (0.5l on tap.)|11/8/2006 3:18:32 PM|Norway||Oslo|India Pale Ale (IPA)
66353|Oslo Bayer|Oslo Mikrobryggeri|5|4|6|3|13|3.1|Medium white body. Red body with carbonation and faint haziness. Acidic harmonic aroma of wild berries and bread. Slightly odd. Bitter, resiny hop taste initially, followed by dry roasty malt taste. Bitter taste lingers. Hmmmm. They must have put quite a bit of hops into this, maybe more than suits such a thin-bodied beer. Quite good, and very drinkable. Served too cold, as usual. (0.5l on tap.)|11/8/2006 3:14:59 PM|Norway||Oslo|Vienna
28671|Nøgne Ø Julesnadder (2003-2007)|Nøgne Ø|7|4|7|4|16|3.8|Big brown head over opaque black body. Complex, harmonic sweetish aroma of peppery coffee, burnt malts, pine needles, and chocolate. Taste is soft, harmonic burntness, coffee, chocolate, and pine needles with faint vanilla and spice notes. Bitter, burnt aftertaste. Woody notes linger. Good, firm mouthfeel, yet soft. This is a great beer. Kind of like a very good spicy stout. (0.5l bottle, batch 258.)|11/7/2006 3:40:33 PM|Norway||Grimstad|Porter
18296|CB Juleøl 4.7%|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|6|4|6|3|12|3.1|Biggish coarse offwhite head shrinks quickly. Red body. Light roasty, harmonic aroma with notes of peas and faint sweetness. Taste is very similar, a mix of roastiness, peas and a light bitterness. Watery aftertaste. The roasty bitterness lingers. A decent Christmas beer.

28717|Fredrikstad Juleøl 4.5%|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|3|4|4|2|8|2.1|Big offwhite head shrinks rapidly. Red body with some carbonation. Light rubbery aroma, possibly with a hint of roastiness behind the rubber. Taste is watery bitter rubber with roasty, grainy aftertaste. Too watery for my taste, and definitely too much rubber. Yuck. I'd rather have a decent pilsener with my Christmas dinner. (0.33l bottle.)|11/7/2006 2:20:42 PM|Norway||Bergen|Vienna

Faint, but relatively firm, sweetish aroma of roasty malts, licorice, and some form of spice, with notes of butter. Taste is sweetish butter and cinnamon with a watery, roasty malt aftertaste. Dry, roasty taste lingers. Smooth, yet watery mouthfeel. This is better than most Norwegian pilseners, but pretty boring for a Christmas beer. Nothing really wrong with it, though.

62848|Oppigårds Slåtteröl|Oppigårds Bryggeri|7|4|7|3|15|3.6|Huge creamy white shiny head over pale copper body with a faint haze and a very slight carbonation. Light, sweetish malty aroma with complex hoppy background with notes of resin. Taste is lovely bitterish and sweetish malts with grain and straw notes and a strong hoppy background. Aftertaste is bitter grain and dandelion. This is an excellent beer, but perhaps a bit too austerely bitter in the aftertaste. I would have given it an 8 for flavour if it wasn't for that.

Very faint aroma with traces of caramel and wood. Thin watery taste of something that could possibly be caramel malts. There are traces of typical English hops, too.

Firm, harmonic woody taste of pepper, cloves, and hops. Very soft, smooth and well-rounded. Has a sharpish burnt edge as well, which kind of defines the beer. Very nice, and highly drinkable.

Faint sweetish aroma with honey-like aspects, but really kind of bland. Alcohol-like notes. Intensely sweet light honey taste with gingery, sugary notes and strong alcohol or vodka notes. Slick, buttery mouthfeel. Too sweet, and there isn't enough to balance the sweetness. Drinkable. Interesting, but I wouldn't drink a lot of this.

Soft sweetish aroma of cognac, honey, and flowers with marzipan notes. Strong, sweet honey taste with apricot liquor notes. Some acidity, which keeps it from being too sweet. Harmonic and balanced.

Taste is soft, smooth sweetish roasty licorice with chocolatey notes. Like a schwarzbier, but with more taste. Nice, a really good effor, despite the clear industrial taste.

11627|Nynäshamns Pickla Pils|Nynäshamns Ångbryggeri|6|4|7|4|14|3.5|Big coarse white head over slightly hazy yellow body. Light citric hop aroma. (Bottle claims the hop is Saaz, but it doesn't smell at all like it.) Light, sweetish, bitter taste of resiny hops, with a dry aftertaste. Clean, crisp mouthfeel. Excellent pilsener, one of the best I've tasted, if you can call this a pilsener at all. (0.5l bottle.)|11/2/2006 5:06:20 PM|Sweden||Nynäshamn|Bohemian Pilsener
53261|Aass Jule-Uten|Aass Bryggeri|5|4|5|3|11|2.8|Biggish offwhite head over brown body with carbonation. Soft, grainy aroma of dry straw. Bitter, sweetish taste of caramel, faintly roasty malts, and straw. Dry caramel taste lingers. It doesn't really taste like a real beer, but it's not bad, either. I guess if what you are looking for is a substitute for normal Christmas beer, this isn't it, but if you just want something beerlike without alcohol it might work just fine.

65750|Mongozo Coconut 3.5%|Brouwerij Huyghe|3|3|3|2|6|1.7|Head comes out of the bottle when you open it. Medium white head over hazy white body with a yellow tinge. Sweet coconut aroma with a sharp artificial marzipan-like background. Taste is sweet coconut with the same sharpish artificial taste behind it, and a quite powerful bitter, metallic hop ending. Milky mouthfeel and taste. It's not awful like the banana thing, but the bitterness doesn't go very well with the coconut taste. Drinkable.

14018|Mongozo Banana|Brouwerij Huyghe|1|3|1|1|1|0.7|Small white head over hazy yellow body. Sweet banana aroma, initially fine, then followed by a disgusting papery, milky background with faint notes of licorice. The taste also starts out well with sweet banana, then lurches into a violent taste of wet toilet paper, licorice, metal, rotten banana, and, I swear, a whiff of shit. This is just absolutely dreadful. It fails to be boring in the same way that axe murders fail to be boring. I&#8217;ve only taken two sips, so I can&#8217;t analyze the taste very well, but there is no way I am drinking any more of this. This sets a new low for me. It&#8217;s a shame it looked OK, since giving it a 1 for appearance would have made me happy. (0.33l bottle.)|10/31/2006 4:09:38 PM|Belgium||Melle|Fruit Beer
704|Beck's Alkoholfrei|Brauerei Beck & Co./Becks (InBev)|2|2|2|1|3|1|Medium white head over pale yellow body. Rubbery aroma with notes of wet cardboard and something that reminds me of sweaty socks. Bitter rubbery, watery taste of grain and metal. The wateriness makes it really disgusting. A lingering taste not entirely unlike vomit. Chalky, mouthfeel a little like acid. Vaguely, at the back, there are traces of floral hops. This is crap. If you don't want to get drunk, drink water. Poured out the rest.

66088|Munkholm Spesial Til Julens Kjøttretter|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|5|4|5|3|8|2.5|Medium offwhite head over deep reddish brown body. Sweetish malty aroma of rock candy. Reminiscent of the other Munkholm Spesial, but fainter and less complex. Taste is watery roasty malts and brown sugar with a touch of cardboard and straw. Some bitterness in the aftertaste. It's OK, but nothing special. Better than most in the Munkholm range. (0.33l bottle.)|10/30/2006 12:57:03 PM|Norway||Oslo|Low Alcohol
66087|Munkholm Spesial Til Julens Fiskeretter|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|6|4|5|3|9|2.7|Medium offwhite head over pretty chestnut brown body. A bit light for a Christmas beer. Sweet malty aroma with notes of rock candy, cinnamon, and a little straw. Taste is sweet watery cardboard, with a dry, bitter metal aftertaste. Very low on taste, but apart from the metal there isn't much in the way of off tastes, either. Not bad. In fact, probably the best beer in the Munkholm series.

7934|Sagres|Sociedad Central de Cervejas - Centralcer (Heineken)|5|2|6|3|11|2.7|Small white head shrinks into thin white ring. Yellow body. Sweetish vaguely caramelly and maybe grassy alcoholic aroma. Sweetish grassy caramelly malt taste. Dry, grassy aftertaste. The hoppy background runs throughout the entire taste. This isn't a great beer, but it's not bad, either. It's the hops that make it, really. (0.33l bottle.)|10/29/2006 2:36:03 AM|Portugal||Vialonga|Pale Lager
5574|Heineken Oud Bruin|Heineken Nederland|5|2|5|3|9|2.4|Small offwhite coarse head quickly dissolves into nothing. Opaque black body. Faint, sweetish licorice aroma. Sweet, watery, grainy taste with licorice and straw notes, but no balancing bitterness. Clean, but noring, with a kind of flat, empty taste. Could be a reasonable Oud Bruin for all  I know.

Sweetish milky caramel aroma with harmonic chocolate and roasty notes and a faint background of wood and pine needle hops. Deep, soft milky roasty caramel and chocolate taste. Very harmonic and incredibly smooth, like velvet. Sharpish pine needle background, and a touch of soot. Dry, roasty aftertaste with chocolatey notes. Wonderful! What a pleasure this beer is, especially after rating so much bullshit. (0.33l bottle. Wish it was an 0.75.)|10/27/2006 4:06:46 PM|United States|Colorado|Boulder|Porter

Taste is mostly cardboard with some sweetish malts and a bit of hops in the background. Aftertaste is dry and chalky. The aroma almost scared me off, but the beer is actually drinkable, if not exactly great.

Very smooth mouthfeel, almost a bit oily. Dry, metallic aftertaste with roasty notes and some chalk. Quite a bit of taste, so even if I'm not too fond of all the components of the taste, at least the beer isn't boring.

Sweetish, smoky, floral aroma reminiscent of roses with notes of berries. Somewhat unbalanced. Sweet watery taste of flowers and earth, strongly spicy, with notes of cardamom and licorice. Complex and interesting, but somehow it makes me feel sick. I&#8217;m giving it a poor rating here, but that may simply be because something in it happens to disagree violently with me in a way it might not with others. &#40;0.33l bottle.

Sweetish, aroma of licorice and malts with indistinct hoppy notes. Something stale and muddy in the aroma prevents it from getting top scores. Taste is sweetish, watery licorice with the same stale, muddy off taste. Dryish aftertaste. Best before date is 07.07.06, which was around the time when we bought it at Ølbutikken in Copenhagen. Giving it slightly better marks than it deserves to make up for this. Need to rerate this one. (0.6l bottle.)|9/23/2006 3:20:46 PM|Denmark||København|Irish Ale

Some spice as well. Quite bitter, but this is well masked by the rest. Dryish, fruity aftertaste. Very good, but perhaps a bit lacking in complexity.

I don't think it's really a great beer, but nobody can fault them for being too bland. (0.5l bottle.)|9/22/2006 3:32:17 PM|Germany|Saxony|Zwickau|Classic German Pilsener
50187|Trio Lettøl|Trio Bryggeri|4|2|4|2|6|1.8|Medium white head shrinks quickly. Pale yellow body with carbonation. Sweetish soft caramelly aroma with butter notes. Light, bitter, sweetish taste with floral hop notes (wow! in a Norwegian lager!). Unfortunately, an acidic papery aftertaste with notes of grain and chalk appears after the more promising initial taste. Thin-bodied. Further down the bottle a sour, unpleasant aftertaste emerges. Yuck. (0.33l bottle.)|9/20/2006 3:11:44 PM|Norway||Skien|Low Alcohol
64637|Stary Melnik Bezalkogolnoe|Pivovar Moskva (Efes Russia)|2|2|2|1|1|0.8|Big white head quickly shrinks into a thin ring. Pale yellow body with some carbonation. Vaguely sulphurous chalky aroma with something I won't bother to identify, because this smells horrible anyway. Taste is chalky watery bitterness initially. Aftertaste is watery bitterness. Very unpleasant. I can't imagine that anyone would enjoy this. It reminds me of what you vomit when you've only water in your stomach. (0.5l bottle.)|9/17/2006 11:03:43 AM|Russia||Moscow|Low Alcohol
64636|Sixteen Tons Krasnoe Osoboe|Sixteen Tons|4|4|6|3|12|2.9|Small offwhite head quickly shrinks into thin film. Deep, dark, reddish brown hazy body.

Sweet milky taste with acidic, almost tart aftertaste. Body maybe a bit thin. Mealy, yeasty notes, as well as something citric in the aftertaste. Nice, but maybe a bit too tart.

64635|Durdin Kvas|Durdin|6|4|6|4|13|3.3|No head whatsoever. Dark brown, almost black, opaque body. Sweetish, gingery aroma with roasty notes of dark rye bread, with maybe a touch of cinnamon and caramel. Taste is watery ginger and mild roasty bread. No aftertaste. Soft and silky mouthfeel. Harmonic. Reminiscent of traditional Norwegian homebrew like my grandfather made, but of higher quality. Very nice, if not earthshattering.

Citric banana aroma, faintly tart, acidic and citric, and nothing much else besides. Aftertaste is watery tartness. Disappointing compared to the hefe; too tart.

22398|Taller Pils|Yantar Brewery (Ukraine) (Sun-InBev)|4|2|5|3|8|2.2|Big white coarse head shrinks rapidly into thin white ring. Yellow body with very little carbonation. Sweet dense oily aroma.

64628|Dnipro Klasichne|Sarmat - Donetsk Brewery (SABMiller)|5|3|5|3|10|2.6|Medium white head, pale yellow body. Sweet caramelly faintly fruity aroma.

Taste is sweet straw with grassy hop notes, and the signature Tinkoff papery rubber aftertaste. Not bad, but I&#8217;d prefer to do without the aftertaste.

56313|Gourmetbryggeriet Abstrator|Gourmetbryggeriet (Harboe)|6|5|6|3|14|3.4|Huge offwhite head over reddish bronze body. Very sweet cinnamon and lefse aroma with maybe a touch of wood to it. Taste is deep, sweet cinnamon, with fruity notes. Aftertaste is dry, slightly metallic hops, with dry wooden notes. Some bitterness, and hops of undefinable character. Definitely a good beer, and quite interesting. A bit too one-dimensional for top marks, though. (0.66l bottle.)|9/17/2006 5:06:10 AM|Denmark||Roskilde|Doppelbock
37822|Sixteen Tons Temnoe Dvoynoe|Sixteen Tons|4|4|6|3|13|3|Tiny beige filkm of a head covers half the beer. Opaque black body goes hazy brown at edges. Faint milkiness to an aroma of nothing. Taste is sweet licorice with peppery mouthfeel, and notes of coffee. Some acidity. A bit light, but not bad. Taste could be stronger. Seems Russians want their beers light.

Sweet grain-soup and boiled vegetable aroma, with notes of wet cardboard. Taste is mainly sweetish wet cardboard, turning into powerful cardboard soup at the end, with an awful boiled cabbage off-taste. Dreadful. Didn't finish, even though there is no alcohol, and I'm thirsty. One of the worst beers I've had. (0.5l bottle.)|9/17/2006 4:57:55 AM|Russia||Ufa, Bashkortostan|Low Alcohol

Sweet very fruity taste with grassy, bitter aftertaste. Quite a bit of taste, but somewhat flat and one-dimensional. I was expecting more from a 17-degree beer.

26395|Yantar Svitle|Yantar Brewery (Ukraine) (Sun-InBev)|5|3|5|3|11|2.7|Medium white head over yellow body with faint carbonation. Clean sweetish malty aroma with smoky notes.

Taste is again very fruity and sweetish with notes of metal and grass. Quite bitter. Bitter, metallic grassy aftertaste. Some chalk. There are some alcohol notes, but not enough to detract from the beer. With a bit less bitterhops (and some more aroma hops, maybe Amarillo) this could be a really good beer.

25413|Slavutych Ice|Slavutych (Carlsberg)|4|2|4|3|8|2.1|Very pale yellow body, almost no head. White head quickly disappears entirely. Caramelly, buttery aroma. Almost no taste; vague hints of malts and grass, but nothing more. As such, this could be described as a successful ice beer. (0.33l bottle.)|9/15/2006 6:05:28 AM|Ukraine||Zaporizhzhya|Pale Lager
25797|Taller Ice|Yantar Brewery (Ukraine) (Sun-InBev)|3|3|5|3|9|2.3|Small offwhite creamy head over deep yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Sweetish vegetable aroma. Taste is alcohol with faint bitterness, and a maize-like off taste. Rounded body. Dryish, cider-like aftertaste. Decent, but definitely not an ice beer in the usual sense of the term.

Taste is milky grain with a dry, pine needle hope aftertaste. Very simple, but definitely good for a non-alcoholic lager.

4531|Obolon Soborne|Obolon|4|3|5|3|9|2.4|Medium white head; yellow body with faint ongoing carbonation. Aroma of rubber and straw; very faint.

36614|Arsenal Svitle|Slavutych (Carlsberg)|4|3|5|3|9|2.4|Medium white head; clear yellow body with ongoing carbonation. No discernible aroma. Rounded, empty taste with an acidic, lemony finish.

25880|Rogan Traditsiyne Svitle|Rogan (Sun-InBev)|4|3|5|3|9|2.4|Small white head; clear yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Faint, sweetish, rubbery aroma with notes of perfume. Taste is neutral malts, maybe some grain, with a chalky, bitter aftertaste with faint spiciness. One of the most boring beers I've ever had. Doesn't even have the distinction of sucking in an interesting way. (0.5l bottle.)|9/15/2006 5:47:56 AM|Ukraine||Kharkiv|Pale Lager
44746|Pshenychne Etalon|Radomyshl Beer and Beverage Plant (Ridna Marka)|6|3|6|3|12|3|Big creamy white head; clear pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation.

Earthy, port-like aroma with notes of cloth, yeast, and cream. Acidic taste of apricot, stale cloth, and port. Acidity all the way through. Creamy wood, and other strange things.

Milky, rubbery aroma with some sweetish malts and a touch of caramel. Taste is delicate, very lightly roasted malts with a milky, faintly yeasty background. Bringing up the rear is a slightly dry, nutty aftertaste. Some acidity to the bitterness, and in some ways reminiscent of a weizen. Drinkable, and somewhat interesting; not at all bad.

Sweet, sugary aroma of pear and alcohol with strong artificial notes. Intensely sweet, somewhat cloying, taste of watery pear and a little metal.

Dry-sweetish floral grassy herbal taste with peppery notes. Mild, soft mouthfeel with faint buttery slickness. Mid-to-light body. Dry sugary floral aftertaste with herbal papery notes.

Sweetish malty taste with pea-like hop background. Aftertaste is dominated by the pea-like hops. More aroma hops than usual for Norwegian lagers, bonus points for that. Faintly grainy taste lingers.

Sweetish fruity taste with some perfume. Soft coffeeish aftertaste with touches of chocolate. Delicate, but a bit too watery, I think. Again a light delicate hop touch.

Yeasty aroma of boiled peas with notes of roastiness and cappucino. Very unusual. Taste is soft roastiness with hoppy pea-like notes and some yeast. Aftertaste is grassy hops and soft burntness. Unidentifiable spicy taste at the back, probably the juniper. Faint chocolate notes also detectable. Mouthfeel is silky. Very nice. I've no idea what beer type this is supposed to be (traditional Norwegian, what's that?), but the beer is excellent. (0.5l bottle.)|6/29/2006 8:01:09 AM|Norway||Steinkjer|Traditional Ale

Deep, sweet aroma of hickory, cloves, cinnamon, and some paper. Notes of licorice. Taste is dark wood, some bitterness, and the aftertaste is a mix of licorice, wood, and tar.

36573|Grans Bare Fotball|Grans Bryggeri|2|2|1|1|1|0.7|Small white head quickly disappears, leaving only thin ring round the edge. Copper body, with some ongoing carbonation. Aroma is watery and unbalanced, but brings up many associations. Strong butter odour with roasty caramel notes and maybe a touch of wood and metal. It's really bad, but I'm saving the 1 in the hope that something worse will show up one day. Watery roasty caramel flavour with aftertaste of watery burnt wood and metal. Notes of butter, too. Some hops and bitterness are detectable. A really disgusting salty buttery metal taste lingers. Palate is buttery, and it feels like the beer leaves a metal butter film in your mouth. Overall, this is astonishingly bad. This is the first beer that's made me want to rinse my mouth afterwards. The initial taste isn't really as bad as the aroma, but the aftertaste is dreadful. Well. What can I say? It's kind of fun to rate, since the taste is so complex, but I would rather drink fermented well-used soccer socks, I think.

Sugary soda-pop aroma with unbalanced dark caramel and water, plus some vaguely roasty traces and butter. There&#8217;s quite a bit of aroma, but it&#8217;s completely lacking in balance, and has too much water and sugar, not to mention butter. Taste is watery, grainy caramel with an aftertaste of caramel and straw. Notes of butter here, too, and traces of metallic bitterness. This is just very, very poor.

58700|Mack Ludwig Premium Pale Ale|Mack Bryggeri|6|2|6|2|12|2.8|Big white head of very coarse lace quickly dissolves into nothing. Deep copper body. Sweet, deep fruity, malt aroma with traces of English hops. Taste is again sweet fruity malts with notes of raisins and some sharply bitter hops. Sharp, bitter aftertaste with some fruits and quite a bit of metal at the end. I generally like hops and bitterness, but here I think Mack has made the usual Norwegian mistake of using only bitter-hops and no aroma hops, which gives us lots of bitterness and none of that lovely hop aroma. A shame, because if they had used more aroma this could have been a good beer. (0.44l can. Thanks to grove for passing this on.)|6/9/2006 1:00:02 PM|Norway||Tromsø|English Pale Ale

Sweetish light malty taste with light grassy hop aftertaste. Notes of grain throughout. Faint bitterness lingers together with the grain notes. Overall the taste is clean, smooth, and not really very strong or interesting. It&#8217;s an ice beer, so this is as expected. The grain is a little unpleasant, though.

Dry lemony papery taste with citric notes. Mid-bodied. Bitterish citric papery aftertaste. A bit bland, but does have the papery house signature, and a little character. Certainly drinkable. &#40;0.33l bottle, Xaghra Discount Supermarket, Xaghra, Gozo. Rated twice.&#41;|6/7/2006 1:59:01 PM|Malta||Mriehel|English Pale Ale

Clean, light, malty taste, with some caramel and watery grain. Faintly grassy hop background. Aftertaste is slight bitterness with a touch of grass.

It's a &quot;summer beer&quot;, and while it's not a total disgrace it's not really very exciting, either. (0.5l can.)|5/12/2006 3:13:59 PM|Norway||Drammen|Pale Lager

Sweetish softly metallic hop aroma with notes of rubber and pepper. Peppery, sweetish taste of malts with strong soft metallic hop background (and, again, some rubber). Aftertaste is bitter pepper.

4688|Aass Bayer|Aass Bryggeri|6|4|7|3|14|3.4|Deep dark red body, smallish creamy offwhite head. Slightly acidic, spicy aroma. Cinnamon? Pepper? Lovely, deep, sweetish malty cinnamon taste with roasty cinnamon aftertaste. Quite complex. Roasty pepper taste lingers. An excellent bayer! Easily the best in Norway.

11148|Hansa Sommerøl|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|3|3|5|2|10|2.3|Medium creamy white head with some holes. Clear yellow body. Weak, strange aroma with notes of what appears to be watered-down honey mixed with alcohol. Weak, watery faintly bitter flavour with aftertaste of sweetish honey. The faint trace of honey is really what saves this beer from being bad, but the way the honey lingers is kind of nice. Decent, I'd say. (0.5l can.) |5/2/2006 3:27:53 PM|Norway||Bergen|Pale Lager
26858|Borg Ice|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|4|3|5|3|10|2.5|A biggish head of coarse white rapidly-shrinking lace over a copper body with ongoing carbonation. Very faint aroma of clean malty sweetness and a hint of apples; barely detectable. The taste is clean sweetish malts with notes of apple and a faintly bitter aftertaste with the smallest hint of smoke. A true ice beer this, with hardly any taste at all. It's drinkable, but boring.

Light milky rubbery grain aroma with a touch of straw and perhaps some hops. Taste is light rubbery grain with notes of milk and a faint metallic bitter aftertaste. Metallic bitterness lingers. Very little taste, and what's there isn't too nice. I doubt I'll have this again. Given the choice between this and water I think I prefer water.

Clear yellow body with some occasional carbonation. Very light, cool aroma with notes of apples and milky rubber. Fresh, inoffensive aroma, but nothing much there. Light, malty taste again with hints of apple and a faintly bitter aftertaste. Some taste of coriander, rubber, and grapefruit in the bitterness, which is quite unpleasant. Mouthfeel is somewhat watery. Bitter grapefruit taste lingers. I didn't think much of this. It's mainly bitter and unpleasant. I don't imagine this will be a great seller this summer.

Deep, clean, somewhat delicate aroma of old hops, light fruit, and sweetish malts with notes of banana and spices; some alcohol aroma. Light, delicate, velvety taste of sweetish malty with strong old hop overtones with faint mustiness and notes of banana. Aftertaste is old hops with a little bitterness, which lingers.

Intense, sweet licorice and anise aroma with notes of chocolate and bready yeast and a touch of vanilla. Taste is deep, intense spiciness, mostly anise and licorice, but also pepper, cinnamon, chocolate, and some burntness, and god alone knows what else. Toffee, sweetness. The aftertaste is bitter chocolate anise, with lingering anise. What can I say? This is an undying classic. (0.33l bottle.)|4/21/2006 5:12:08 PM|Belgium||Rochefort|Abt/Quadrupel
6117|Nils Oscar Barley Wine (-2010)|Nils Oscar|6|3|7|4|15|3.5|Smallish off-white coarse-laced head, subsides quickly. Body is a handsome, dark chestnut brown. At a distance the aroma is distinctly bready, but up close it becomes a mix of sweet, spicy caramel and alcohol, with stale raisins thrown in. Sweetness is a little sickly, perhaps. Broad, deep, intensely sweet taste of spicy, burnt caramel with a lovely aftertaste of charcoal malts with a faint bitterness. A taste of dry, roasted wood lingers. An excellent barley wine. I was a bit let down by the aroma, expecting more from Nils Oscar, but the taste makes up for it. (0.33l bottle.)|4/21/2006 4:23:34 PM|Sweden||Nyköping|Barley Wine

Sweetish, roasty malt taste, thinnish, with a lovely, velvety, sooty, burnt toast aftertaste. Silky smooth mouthfeel. Silky sootiness lingers. A very good beer. It could do with some more body, but I just love the smooth burntness. (0.5l bottle.)|4/10/2006 5:13:20 PM|Czech Republic||Krusovice|Schwarzbier
4934|Westvleteren 12 (XII)|Westvleteren Abdij St. Sixtus|8|5|8|4|17|4.2|Smallish light beige head over cloudy dark red body. Strong, alcoholic, bready aroma with notes of licorice and soft port wine, with maybe a little chocolate. Soft, deep, licorice and bread taste with plenty of alcohol warmth. Chocolatey, yeasty notes hover. Impressively harmonic and soft, yet somehow powerful. Aftertaste just fades out. A spicy licorice taste lingers. Very little bitterness is detectable. Clearly a great beer. Think this was a new bottle.|4/10/2006 4:04:03 PM|Belgium||Westvleteren|Abt/Quadrupel
51528|Slottskällans Vintersemester|Slottskällans Bryggeri|6|3|6|2|13|3|Huge head of fine white lace slowly subsides. Deep yellow body with lots of ongoing carbonation. Light, faintly malty aroma with strong pea-like, resiny hop notes. Chalky, sweetish taste of soft malts with a pea-like, resiny, bitter aftertaste. It&#8217;s a good beer, but I&#8217;m not too keen on the lack of body combined with the hop character, hence the relatively low rating. (0.5l bottle.) |4/10/2006 2:59:34 PM|Sweden||Uppsala|Premium Lager
11154|Ringnes Skjærgårds Pils|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|3|2|3|2|5|1.5|Medium-sized, coarse-laced white head, subsides quickly, leaving no trace. Light copper body with ongoing carbonation. Hardly any aroma at all; a very little malty sweetness with faint traces of rubber and butter. Faintly malty taste with bitter butter and rubber. No real finish, except a yeasty taste lingering. This is just completely useless. Hardly any taste at all, and what little is there is not very pleasant. I find it hard to believe a company with all the resources Ringnes has could produce this kind of stuff. |4/9/2006 4:05:09 PM|Norway||Oslo|Pale Lager
56909|Svaneke Gul Påske|Svaneke Bryghus|4|3|6|2|11|2.6|Medium sized, coarse-laced white head over faintly hazy pale yellow body with some ongoing carbonation. Sweetish, chalky aroma of, uh, potatoes? Maybe some notes of peas and vegetables as well. Taste is sweetish chalk and peas, with a dry, bitter finish. Some hop background throughout. Very strange. Can't say I really like it, but it's not really bad, either. (0.5l bottle.)|4/9/2006 2:21:59 PM|Denmark||Svaneke|Dortmunder/Helles
4690|Aass Gull|Aass Bryggeri|6|3|6|3|11|2.9|Medium offwhite head over clear deep yellow body. Sweet malty aroma with notes of bread and alcohol and a touch of noble hops. Sweet marzipan taste with notes of grassy hops and grain. Some alcohol heat. Some butter. Decent, but nothing special. (0.33l bottle.)|4/9/2006 1:41:10 PM|Norway||Drammen|Pale Lager
57802|Haandbryggeriet Påskegodt|Haandbryggeriet (Norway)|6|4|7|4|14|3.5|Smallish white head over dark orange, almost brown, hazy body. Sweet malty aroma with citrusy hops and notes of pepper. Not very strong aroma. Sweet, malty, peppery taste with a background of roastiness and distinctive citrusy hop notes throughout. Citrusy, bitter aftertaste. Bitter, resiny taste lingers. Silky mouthfeel. Slightly watery body. A good easter brew. (Batch #28 on bottle.)|4/6/2006 4:17:56 PM|Norway||Drammen|Belgian Ale
8296|Erdinger Champ|Erdinger Weissbräu|6|3|6|3|12|3|Medium white fine-laced head over hazy dark yellow body. Mild round wheat aroma with refreshing sourish spice notes with a hint of banana. Full, rounded wheat taste with quite refreshing spice taste. Slightly mealy mouthfeel. Aftertaste is dry spices with a touch of metal. An OK weizen, but not very remarkable. |4/6/2006 3:15:18 PM|Germany|Bavaria|Erding|German Hefeweizen
11823|Staropramen Velvet|Staropramen Breweries (StarBev)|5|4|6|4|12|3.1|Medium offwhite creamy head over light chestnut brown body. Light caramel aroma with notes of straw and a little hops. Nice, soft mouthfeel. Burnt, soft caramel taste, somewhat watery, with a dry, bitter aftertaste. Some hops in the background throughout. Well-made, but boring.

4700|Lapin Kulta III|Hartwall (Heineken)|6|3|6|3|12|3|Biggish white coarse-laced head over pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation and bubbles along the side of the glass. Clean, sweetish, malty aroma with notes of apple and maybe hints of marzipan. Clean, sweet taste of malt and apple, with an aftertaste of marzipan. Some bitterness throughout. Spicy, malty taste lingers. For an industrial lager this is very good. |3/26/2006 3:49:54 PM|Finland||Helsinki|Pale Lager
52342|Sofiero Original 4.6%|Sofiero/Kopparbergs Bryggerier|4|3|5|3|10|2.5|Medium white creamy head over pale yellow body. Sourish grainy aroma with hints of rubber. Clean, sweetish taste with some malts, quite bitter, with some metal. Aftertaste spicy bitterness. A decent pilsener, mostly dominated by bitterness. Apart from the bitterness this is just an utterly normal industrial lager. Why bother importing this? (Can.)|3/26/2006 6:27:23 AM|Sweden||Laholm|Pale Lager
56243|Kozel Medium 11° Svetly Lezak|Pivovar Velké Popovice (SAB Miller)|6|4|6|3|12|3.1|Big offwhite medium laced head over clear copper body. Acidic, fruity aroma with some hops.

5943|Jämtlands Postiljon|Jämtlands Bryggeri|7|4|7|3|14|3.5|Big beige head that&#8217;s creamy round the side and coarse-laced in the middle. Dark red body. Sweetish malty lightly roasted aroma with strong resin/pepper hop aroma. Sweet hoppy roasty taste, slightly watery, with hoppy malty, burnt aftertaste. Notes of licorice and grain. Unusual, but nice. |3/18/2006 2:41:41 PM|Sweden||Pilgrimstad|Premium Bitter/ESB
25941|Staropramen Sládk&#367v M&#283s&#357an (Lehké Svetlé)|Staropramen Breweries (StarBev)|5|3|5|4|10|2.7|Biggish white coarse head over clear yellow body. Fresh, grassy aroma with hints of malty acidity. Acidic fresh taste of grassy hops and some grain; aftertaste is metallic bitterness. Metallic bitterness lingers. Decent, but a bit thin and too much metal.|3/18/2006 1:55:26 PM|Czech Republic||Prague|Bohemian Pilsener
8141|Grolsch Herfstbok|Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (SABMiller)|6|3|6|3|12|3|Small offwhite coarse-laced head over clear dark red body. Sweet, bready, marzipan-like aroma with notes of wild berries. Taste is sweet berries with some sugar. Faint maltiness with the smallest hint of roastiness. Aftertaste is sugar and faint burntness. Perhaps a touch watery. Overall a decent bock, but somewhat boring.|3/18/2006 1:52:58 PM|Netherlands||Boekelo|Dunkler Bock
28967|Brugge Tripel |Brouwerij Palm|7|4|8|4|16|3.9|Thin white creamy head over hazy orange-red body. Sweet bready aroma with notes of unidentifiable spice. Intense, sweet taste of cinnamon, cardamom, and coriander (I think). Aftertaste of marzipan with some bitterness and sweetness. Lingering spicy bitterness. An excellent trippel. (Why are people calling this thin and watery? I found the taste to be very strong indeed. Strange.)|3/12/2006 2:33:01 PM|Belgium||Steenhuffel|Abbey Tripel
26421|Radegast Original|Radegast (SABMiller)|5|3|5|2|9|2.4|Medium white head over light copper body. Light, grainy, hoppy aroma with notes of metal. Light taste of grain and butter, with a bitter, metallic aftertaste. Well. Didn't really enjoy this one much. |3/11/2006 3:28:00 PM|Czech Republic||Nosovice|Bohemian Pilsener
35994|Carlsberg Semper Ardens First Gold I.P.A.|Carlsberg Brewery|6|4|6|3|13|3.2|Medium offwhite coarse head over light brown body. Sweet toffeeish aroma. Taste is very sweet and lightly roasted with a faintly bitter, nutty aftertaste. Sweetish bitterness lingers. A bit watery and lacking in complexity, but decent, even if more like a barley wine than an IPA. |3/11/2006 3:15:04 PM|Denmark||Copenhagen|India Pale Ale (IPA)
11113|Hansa Premium|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|5|3|6|2|11|2.7|Smallish white head over clear yellow body with a tiny amount of ongoing carbonation. Head rapidly shrinks into a thin film covering half the beer. Clean, acidic aroma with faint notes of apple and raisins, and a bit of water. Taste is sweetish, clean and grainy with a somewhat watery mouthfeel and a hint of straw in the finish. Somewhat bitter. Not at all bad for a Norwegian pilsener. |3/11/2006 1:16:57 PM|Norway||Bergen|Pale Lager
4679|Saison Dupont Biologique|Brasserie Dupont|7|4|7|4|15|3.7|Huge creamy offwhite head with larger bubbles. Acidic, metallic, earthy aroma with notes of rubber that, remarkably, is appetizing and refreshing. Soft, sweetish, intensely grainy and earthy taste with strongly bitter aftertaste. Complex, somewhat harsh, but still easily drinkable. Citric background throughout. As a saison, this is almost unimprovable.|3/11/2006 8:52:56 AM|Belgium||Tourpes-Leuze|Saison
45950|Flying Dog Gonzo Imperial Porter |Flying Dog Brewery|8|5|8|4|17|4.2|Enormous dark brown creamy head with larger bubbles. Totally opaque black body. Sweetish piney resiny aroma of hickory, cork with notes of juniper. Taste is enormous, roasty pine malts and at once sweetish and acidic with notes of wild berries, tar and most other things on earth and above it; very complex. Wow! A great beer, if somewhat overpowering.|3/11/2006 8:48:47 AM|United States|Maryland|Frederick|Imperial/Strong Porter
15181|L'Alchimiste India Pale Ale|L'Alchimiste|6|3|7|3|15|3.4|Offwhite, small head. Hazy dark orange body. Sweet, broad, marzipan roasty aroma, vaguely creamy and cognac-like. Sweet, malty, roasted almonds, sugary taste with dry, bitter aftertaste. Surprisingly little aroma, which is disappointing in an IPA, but by no means a poor beer.|3/11/2006 8:44:40 AM|Canada|Quebec|Joliette|India Pale Ale (IPA)
2012|Traquair House Ale|Traquair House|5|5|7|3|14|3.4|Medium beige offwhite creamy head with larger bubbles. Dark red-brown body. Sweetish musty aroma rather like whipped cream. Sweet, smoky, lightly roasty taste with notes of licorice. Sweetish, dry aftertaste. Good, quite interesting.|3/11/2006 8:41:16 AM|Scotland||Innerleithen, Borders|Scotch Ale
594|Rogue Old Crustacean Barleywine|Rogue Ales|8|5|8|4|17|4.2|Medium creamy light brown head with some larger bubbles. Hazy dark brown body. Sweet, lightly roasted, oaken aroma; very harmonic, complex, and not too heavy. Intense, sweet, roasty taste initially, giving way to an explosion of hop bitterness (with little attendant aroma) that makes up the vanguard. Oaken, caramelly flavours. Sugary, creamy mouthfeel. A very cool beer, but a bit too excessive to get top scores.|3/11/2006 8:36:44 AM|United States|Oregon|Newport|Barley Wine
46899|Jacobsen Original Dark Lager|Husbryggeriet Jacobsen (Carlsberg)|6|4|7|4|15|3.6|Smallish offwhite head rapidly disappears altogether. Lovely dark red-brown body. Fruity caramel aroma with some roastiness. Sweet, cinnamon-dominated roasty caramel taste with some hops throughout. Faint, short, bitter aftertaste.

720|Gambrinus Premium &#268;erné|Plzensky Prazdroj (SABMiller)|5|5|6|3|13|3.2|Big, offwhite creamy head over seemingly black, but really dark red, body. Sweetish, faintly roasty aroma. Sweetish taste of licorice and faint roastiness with faintly dry aftertaste. Nice, easily drinkable, not too exciting. Overall impression is that it's a beer with very little taste, but still not really boring. (On tap. I think this rating is attached to the right beer, but not absolutely sure. Served at &quot;Two Cats&quot; (whatever that is in Czech), which was very much a Prazdroj house. It was definitely Prazdroj, definitely dark, and definitely 12 degrees. This is the only beer that matches.)|3/6/2006 12:59:59 PM|Czech Republic||Plzen|Dunkel

15603|Branik 12° Svetlé|Staropramen Breweries (StarBev)|5|4|5|3|11|2.8|Big, creamy white head over yellow body. Rated in a very smoky Czech pub, so all I could pick up in the way of aroma was some acidity. Clean, light, faintly malty taste with a refreshing, bitter aftertaste with faint sweetness. A well-made and drinkable lager. (On tap.)|3/6/2006 12:42:19 PM|Czech Republic||Prague|Bohemian Pilsener

6116|Nils Oscar Farm Ale|Nils Oscar|7|4|7|3|15|3.6|Medium offwhite head of coarse lace over brown body. Sweet caramel malt aroma with roasted almond and toffee notes. Taste is very like the aroma with a softly bitter aftertaste. Slightly watery. Delicate, drinkable, interesting, and just plain lovely.

94|Samuel Smiths Taddy Porter|Samuel Smith|8|5|8|4|18|4.3|Huge offwhite creamy head; opaque black body. Thick, sweet, chocolatey aroma with spicy, resiny, tar, roasted coffee, and wild berry notes. Deep, intense taste that is very much like the aroma, but with more emphasis on the coffee and the wild berries. A fantastic porter. I believe this shows that a great porter is not made by the assertiveness of the beer (ie: dumping in heavily roasted malts), but by the balance of the beer (roastiness agains wild berries). A superb beer, one of the best I've had.|2/23/2006 3:47:22 PM|England|North Yorkshire|Tadcaster|Porter

Spicy, citric aroma with fruity, bready notes and stale, metallic hops. Taste is powerfully spicy, citric banana flavours with a strong metallic hop background and earthy notes. Spicy, peppery, dry aftertaste. Fantastic! Drinkable, complex, interesting. Deservedly a world classic. (0.33l bottle.)|2/23/2006 3:15:25 PM|Belgium||Malle|Abbey Tripel
2470|Erdinger Weissbier Kristallklar|Erdinger Weissbräu|6|3|6|3|12|3|Smallish white head; clear yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Fruity wheat aroma with hop notes. Sweetish, fruity taste with apple notes and some wheat and floral hops. Soft aftertaste. A bit much carbonation. A decent kristall, but nothing exciting. Not too keen on the concept of kristall in the first place, I have to admit.|2/23/2006 3:12:19 PM|Germany|Bavaria|Erding|German Kristallweizen
11832|Greene King IPA (Filtered)|Greene King|6|4|5|3|12|3|Medium creamy light beige head with a rash of larger bubbles. Chestnut brown body. Sweetish malty nutty aroma with hints of smoke. Taste is again nutty and sweetish, softly bitter aftertaste. A kind of metallic taste lingers which at first I found unpleasant, but which I got used to after a while. Well. Not enough taste, very little aroma hops. This is more like a weak bitter than an IPA, IMHO.|2/23/2006 12:56:59 PM|England|Suffolk|Bury St. Edmunds|Bitter
2225|Köstritzer Schwarzbier|Köstritzer Schwarzbierbrauerei (Bitburger)|5|5|6|4|13|3.3|Medium beige head over dark red body that is almost opaque black. Faintly sweetish roasty aroma. Deep sweetish taste with some roastiness and burntness with toffee and hop notes. Kind of like unsweetened licorice. Dry, faintly roasty aftertaste. A nice, uncomplicated, easily drinkable schwarzbier. Could be more exciting.|2/23/2006 12:53:54 PM|Germany|Thuringia|Bad Köstritz|Schwarzbier
579|Rogue American Amber Ale|Rogue Ales|6|4|7|4|15|3.6|Biggish off-white coarse-laced head over dark red body. Soft, sweet roasty malt aroma with a touch of hops. Deep, sweet taste of smoky, roasted malts with a toffeeish, marzipany flavour combined with a very nice, grainy hop profile. Yet another excellent beer from Rogue; drinkable, interesting, harmonic. |2/19/2006 3:34:00 PM|United States|Oregon|Newport|Amber Ale
45816|Slottskällans Pale Ale|Slottskällans Bryggeri|7|3|6|3|14|3.3|Medium very coarse white head which subsides into a thin white ring in seconds. Faintly hazy chestnut brown body. Lovely hoppy aroma of grapefruit, grass, and peas. Sweet, smoky, malty taste with quite a bit of bitterness. Quite mild, but overall a nice, understated pale ale; very drinkable. |2/19/2006 2:11:33 PM|Sweden||Uppsala|English Pale Ale
3433|McEwan's India Pale Ale|Wells & Youngs|6|4|6|3|14|3.3|Big creamy very light gray head with larger bubbles, shrinking rapidly. Dark red body. Deep, sweet aroma of smoky, toffeeish malts, and some green apple. Where are the hops? Deep, smoky, sweet malty taste with smoky, bitter aftertaste, which lingers. Smokiness really dominates. Smooth mouthfeel. Quite good, but perhaps a bit too much smoke for my tastes, and not enough else. |2/19/2006 1:08:19 PM|England|Bedfordshire|Bedford|Bitter
591|Rogue Mocha Porter|Rogue Ales|7|4|8|4|15|3.8|Smallish dark beige head over seemingly opaque black body. Sweet harmonic, creamy toffee aroma with notes of piney hops and chocolate. Deep sweet roasty creamy hop taste with notes of vanilla and burnt toast. Lovely! This is just a great beer. Complex, harmonic, and well balanced. |2/17/2006 4:41:46 PM|United States|Oregon|Newport|Porter
251|Asahi Super Dry|Asahi Breweries|4|3|4|3|8|2.2|Biggish white head of fine lace, subsides quickly. Pale yellow body. Sweetish light clean malt aroma with faint fruity spicy notes. Almost no taste at all, just faint fruitiness. In a way it's impressive that it's not watery, despite being almost devoid of taste. Faint hoppy aftertaste. Clearly extremely well made, but sadly all that skill has been expended on removing the taste rather than adding it.|2/17/2006 4:40:43 PM|Japan||Tokyo|Pale Lager
11121|Borg Bokkøl|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|5|4|6|4|14|3.3|Smallish beige creamy head. Very dark red body. Faint sweet toffeeish aroma with notes of marzipan. Sweet, roasty toffeeish taste with syrupy burnt notes. Faintly bitter roasty aftertaste. Very clean-tasting and clearly well made. One of the better Norwegian bocks.|2/17/2006 4:37:04 PM|Norway||Bergen|Dunkler Bock
11488|Jämtlands Fallen Angel Bitter|Jämtlands Bryggeri|6|4|6|3|12|3.1|Huge beige coarse-laced head over chestnut brown body. Aroma is a weak jumble of sweet malts and (citrusy?) hops. Deep sweet taste of roasty marzipan with a bitter hoppy aftertaste with notes of peas and resin (ie: EKG). Smoky notes. Slightly watery. Not that much taste, but definitely a decent beer. |2/16/2006 3:06:59 PM|Sweden||Pilgrimstad|Premium Bitter/ESB
55601|Grans Vinterøl|Grans Bryggeri|4|4|4|2|8|2.2|Medium coarse-laced off-white head shrinks rapidly. Light chestnut brown body. Faint, malty aroma with notes of cardboard. Sweet taste of soft malts with buttery, sugary, cinnamon aftertaste. Watery mouthfeel. Not much taste, and what's there is vaguely unpleasant. Not recommended. |2/16/2006 2:01:25 PM|Norway||Sandefjord|Vienna
12425|Lysholmer Double Ice|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|5|3|4|3|11|2.6|Big white coarse-laced fast-shrinking head over light copper body with occasional carbonation. Clean, sweetish apple-like aroma with very faint notes of malt. Round, clean taste of very little with appleish notes; aftertaste is bitter. Well. It's a successful ice beer, in that there is hardly any taste, and no off taste. |2/16/2006 12:57:46 PM|Norway||Oslo|Pale Lager
6135|Nils Oscar God Lager|Nils Oscar|6|3|6|3|13|3.1|Small white head over copper body. Looks like your standard lager, though not too pale. Sweet malt aroma with notes of grassy hops and some fruitiness. A bit more aroma than your normal lager, and quite nice. Clean, sweet, caramelly malt taste with notes of straw, softly bitter, grassy aftertaste. Subtle, sweet, malty taste lingers. A very nice and well-made lager, with more taste than most, if not terribly exciting. |2/12/2006 2:30:43 PM|Sweden||Nyköping|Dortmunder/Helles
26503|Innis & Gunn Original|Innis & Gunn|6|5|7|5|15|3.8|Big, creamy, off-white head; chestnut brown body. Light, malty aroma with notes of nuts and dried fruit, and perhaps a hint of smoke. Lovely, deep, sweet taste of smoky malts with notes of creamy vanilla and perfume. Aftertaste is dry and smoky. I should definitely have bought more of these.|2/12/2006 12:36:44 PM|Scotland||Edinburgh|English Strong Ale
236|Black Sheep Riggwelter (Bottle)|Black Sheep|6|5|8|4|16|3.9|Huge offwhite fine-laced head over dark red body. Faint, sweet, roasty aroma with hop notes. Deep, sweet, harmonic taste of roasty malts with red fruit character and bitter, tarry aftertaste with sweet chocolatey taste lingering. Complex and interesting. This is a great beer!|2/10/2006 12:55:10 PM|England|North Yorkshire|Ripon|English Strong Ale
11114|Hansa Bayer|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|6|4|5|3|12|3|Medium offwhite creamy head with some larger bubbles; dark red body. Sweet caramel aroma with some roastiness and notes of marzipan. Taste of lightly sweet malty roastiness with faintly bitter, burnt aftertaste. Very watery. Some burntness lingers. Smells nice, but doesn't taste much. A bit of a disappointment. No off flavours, at least.|2/10/2006 12:18:00 PM|Norway||Bergen|Dunkel
23812|Nøgne Ø Pale Ale|Nøgne Ø|7|4|8|4|16|3.9|Small white head, quickly shrinking to thin white ring. Light brown hazy body. Light, clean aroma of citrusy hops with sweet malty notes. Taste is bitter, sweetish malty with deep citrus/resin hop flavour. Aftertaste is bitter citrus. Bitterness lingers, with spicy notes. Oily mouthfeel. A very, very good IPA, and a quite heavy one, too. (Bottle, batch #207.)|2/10/2006 10:34:54 AM|Norway||Grimstad|American Pale Ale
51039|Nils Oscar India Ale|Nils Oscar|7|3|7|4|15|3.6|Big off-white head of cream with bigger bubbles in the middle; clear light brown body. Crisp, clean light malty aroma with a sting of citrusy, resiny hops. Taste is full and sweetly malty with a strong, hoppy citrus/aftertaste. A nice, clean, understated IPA; extremely drinkable.|2/9/2006 2:59:28 PM|Sweden||Nyköping|India Pale Ale (IPA)
55817|Ringnes Cerveza Guajiro Lime & Mynte|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|6|3|3|2|8|2.2|Big white creamy head shrinking quickly atop light yellow body. Aroma of lime and sugar; quite reminiscent of mojito, as the label says. Taste is light and metallic with strong elements of stale lime and rubber. Aftertaste is watery. Bitter aftertaste. Smells nice, but the taste isn't really very pleasant.|2/9/2006 2:13:18 PM|Norway||Oslo|Fruit Beer
55816|Ringnes Akairyu|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|5|2|4|2|8|2.1|Medium creamy white coarse-laced head with light yellow body. LIght, clean, sweetish aroma with spicy notes. Taste is sweetish and lightly malty with a dry aftertaste. Some spice and an unpleasant metallic taste lingers. Watery mouthfeel. Pretty boring, and some off taste. Not as good as the typical Asian macro lagers, and they aren&#8217;t exactly great, either. (0.5l can.)|2/9/2006 1:53:12 PM|Norway||Oslo|Pale Lager
24393|Seidel Lettøl|Aass Bryggeri|5|2|6|3|11|2.7|White medium-sized normal-laced head; light copper body. Light, clean floral hop aroma with faint malty notes. Bitter, floral hop taste with lovely dry, grassy hop aftertaste. Some grain/straw flavour. Metallic taste lingers. For a low alcohol this is very good.|2/9/2006 11:35:23 AM|Norway||Drammen|Low Alcohol
55814|Ringnes Nunavut|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|6|4|6|3|12|3.1|Big light tan creamy head over brownish red body. Aroma is sweet, very fruity, and somewhat peppery. Sweet, fruity taste of roasted malts, with an aftertaste dominated by cinnamon and pepper notes. Peppery cinnamon lingers. Hops can be faintly detected. This is not at all bad; probably my favourite out of the 9 new Ringnes beers.|2/8/2006 4:07:21 PM|Norway||Oslo|Vienna
55844|Munkholm 78°N |Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|3|3|4|2|8|2|Biggish normal off-white head over dark red-brown. Watery, grainy aroma with notes of cardboard. Lots of carbonation in the mouth disturbs the taste. Taste is mostly grain and hops, with notes of cardboard and faint malty sweetness. Aftertaste is somewhat bitter and faintly spicy. Well. Not really bad, but not very good, either.|2/8/2006 3:20:35 PM|Norway||Oslo|Low Alcohol
55840|Munkholm Asia|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|5|2|6|3|10|2.6|Big white coarse-laced head over light yellow body. Light watery aroma of grain and straw with a touch of hops. Light, clean taste of grain with notes of straw and hops, with nicely crisp, spicy, slightly bitter aftertaste. Spicy bitterness lingers. Watery mouthfeel. Not at all bad for a low alcohol. It doesn't really have that spicy sweetness that is typical for Asian beers; it's really more like a better and more watery version of normal Munkholm. The hops are really what makes this beer.|2/8/2006 2:41:26 PM|Norway||Oslo|Low Alcohol
55734|Ringnes Weiss|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|5|4|6|3|11|2.9|Big white fine-laced head over hazy orange body. Aroma of grass with estery banana notes. Taste has quite a bit of banana and wheat with a light, slightly bitter, spicy aftertaste. Milky, mealy mouthfeel, and somewhat watery at the end. Spicy, almost citric, aftertaste lingers. Some unidentifiable off flavours. Not bad, but not really all that great, either.|2/8/2006 2:09:32 PM|Norway||Oslo|German Hefeweizen
55875|Munkholm Cuba|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|3|1|3|2|6|1.5|Medium white head of extremely coarse lace; very pale faintly yellow body. Faint watery citric aroma with hints of grain. Metallic mint/lime taste with bitter rubbery aftertaste. Not really bad, but the lime did not appeal to me at all, and the metallic bitterness does not go well with the lime.|2/8/2006 1:41:00 PM|Norway||Oslo|Low Alcohol
55845|Munkholm Hvete|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|4|3|5|3|9|2.4|Medium white head of coarse lace over hazy pale orange body. Strange, grassy, meaty aroma of grain and wheat with notes of spice (kumin?). Taste is like the aroma, but with more emphasis on the grass and the spice. Some bitterness in the aftertaste and more than a touch of hops. Mild, milky mouthfeel. Some spice and bitterness lingers. Somewhat bland, but refreshing and not at all bad. Lots of hops is generally a good idea in low alcohol beers, but not necessarily in a wheat beer...|2/8/2006 1:17:15 PM|Norway||Oslo|Low Alcohol
46898|Jacobsen Bramley Wit|Husbryggeriet Jacobsen (Carlsberg)|5|3|6|3|13|3|Small white head over hazy yellow body. Slightly acidic aroma with some notes of apple and grain. Full, refreshing taste of wheat, coriander, spice, and maybe some more apple, again somewhat acidic. Mouthfeel slightly grainy. A decent wit.|2/6/2006 3:20:28 PM|Denmark||Valby|Belgian White (Witbier)
18514|De Ryck Christmas Pale-Ale|Brouwerij De Ryck|6|5|6|3|13|3.3|Huge creamy light tan head; hazy dark red body. Sweet spicy peppery aroma. Sweet earthy taste of paradise seeds, yeast, and carbonation with peppery notes. Dry aftertaste. Nice, if not earth-shattering.|2/5/2006 3:50:40 PM|Belgium||Herzele|Belgian Ale
11452|O'Hanlon's Port Stout|O'Hanlon's|6|5|6|3|13|3.3|Small brown head quickly disappears. Barely translucent deep dark red body. Faint fruity licorice aroma with earthy alcohol notes. Dry-sweet earthy roasty taste with plastic notes. Mild, soft mouthfeel. Light body. Dryish roasty grassy earthy aftertaste with plastic notes. Unusual, but not great. &#40;0.1l from bottle at DBF'11.

649|Paulaner Salvator|Paulaner Brauerei (Schörghuber)|8|4|9|4|17|4.2|Medium offwhite creamy head with larger bubbles. Dark red body. Deep aroma of licorice and bread and deep firm malts. Intense grainy sweet hoppy taste of corn, alcohol and caramel. Harmonic. Oily. A fantastic beer.|2/5/2006 3:44:44 PM|Germany|Bavaria|Munich|Doppelbock
18370|Terracotta|Brouwerij De Regenboog|8|4|6|3|13|3.4|Big white head; hazy orange body. Powerful aroma of lemon, coriander, yeast and paradise seeds and notes of bread. Soft, grainy taste of lemon and wheat with yeasty notes. Watery aftertaste. Quite good, but a bit light.|2/5/2006 3:43:01 PM|Belgium||Assebroek-Brugge|Belgian Ale
24172|Celis White (Belgian)|Brouwerij Van Steenberge|6|3|5|3|11|2.8|Thin white head, hazy yellow body. Powerful, dense spicy lemon aroma. Thin, watery oregano yeasty taste. Watery aftertaste. Well. Give me a Hoegaarden instead!|2/5/2006 3:39:54 PM|Belgium||Ertvelde|Belgian White (Witbier)
6860|De Dolle Oerbier|De Dolle Brouwers|6|5|8|5|16|4|Enormous, creamy tan head. Dark red body. Sourish, spicy, unclassifiable aroma with signature de Dolle yeast profile. Deep, intense, sourish licorice taste with strong spicy notes, some cinnamon. Smooth and harmonic, clings to the inside of the mouth. A great beer!|2/5/2006 3:36:55 PM|Belgium||Diksmuide|Belgian Strong Ale
5950|Nynäshamns Indianviken Pale Ale|Nynäshamns Ångbryggeri|6|4|7|4|16|3.7|Big, creamy, offwhite long-lasting head. Hazy dark orange body. Light, clean, resiny hop aroma with malty hints. Sweetish, malty taste with strongly resiny aftertaste. Resiny pine needle taste lingering. Very nice. (On tap.)|2/5/2006 3:32:59 PM|Sweden||Nynäshamn|India Pale Ale (IPA)
44299|Shepherd Neame Original Porter (Cask)|Shepherd Neame|5|4|6|4|13|3.2|Head is thin beige ring; body deep dark brown, just barely translucent. Faint, roasty, chocolatey aroma. Soft, dry, earthy burnt taste with roasty licorice notes and chocolate. Soft, mild mouthfeel. Dry, chocolatey stale aftertaste. Nice. (0.5pt cask at Ashburnham Arms, Greenwich. Update of an earlier rating from Bishop's Arms, Gothenburg in February 2006.)|2/5/2006 3:18:03 PM|England|Kent|Faversham|Porter
51996|Dugges Bältesspännaren|Dugges Ale & Porterbryggeri|6|5|7|4|15|3.7|Big, dark beige creamy head, opaque black body. Sweet chocolatey, roasty harmonic aroma with a touch of hops. Deep, sweet, roasty, coffeeish taste with bitter, dry aftertaste with clear hop notes. Nice, easily drinkable porter. (On tap.)|2/5/2006 3:12:39 PM|Sweden||Landvetter|Porter
24154|Slottskällans I.P.A.|Slottskällans Bryggeri|7|3|7|3|15|3.5|Dark orange hazy body. Thin white head. Grainy, resiny hop aroma, somewhat reminiscent of Goose Island IPA. Deep, broad sweet taste of grain and grassy, resiny hops with a touch of peas. EKG? Grainy, dry aftertaste. A very nice light UK-style IPA.|2/4/2006 5:25:33 AM|Sweden||Uppsala|India Pale Ale (IPA)
41771|Närke Stormaktsporter|Närke Kulturbryggeri|7|5|8|4|16|4|Small, creamy, dark brown head. Opaque black body. Deep, rounded, harmonic chocolate roasty aroma. Deep, powerful, sweetish taste of chocolate and honey, with afteratste of burnt toast and hops. Faintly sourish, probably because of the honey. Vaguely oily mouthfeel. Lovely! A great beer!|2/3/2006 4:33:36 PM|Sweden||Örebro|Imperial Stout
7580|Victoria Bitter|Carlton & United Breweries  (CUB)|5|3|3|2|7|2|Small, white head, clear yellow body. Sourish, marzipany aroma with floral hop notes. Sour, bitter taste with vague floral hop notes. Metallic sourish taste lingering. Yuck! This is awful! What's going on? Why did they make it like this? (Bought it thinking it was a UK-style bitter , only to get a rude surprise.)|2/3/2006 4:28:05 PM|Australia||Melbourne, Victoria|Pale Lager
10057|Mariestads Export|Spendrups Bryggeri|4|3|5|3|11|2.6|Big, white coarse-laced head over yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Faint aroma of straw. Sweet, malty, grainy taste with dry aftertaste of roasted malts. Dry, roastiness lingers. Some floral hops can be detected. A straightforward lager with some more taste than usual, plus for no off flavours.|2/2/2006 3:15:16 PM|Sweden||Grängesberg|Pale Lager
44802|Hansa Ultra Lavkarbo|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|4|3|3|3|6|1.9|Medium offwhite head shrinks quickly into a thin ring around the side of the glass. Body is light copper, with the occasional bubble drifting upwards. Faint, sourish malt aroma. Rounded, malty taste that's quite sourish, with a bitter aftertaste with a disgusting watery strawberry-like flavour to it. Strange. The onset of the taste is nice, but the finish is awful. This product can't possibly have a future.|1/31/2006 5:27:41 PM|Norway||Bergen|Pale Lager
11112|Hansa Pilsner (Norway)|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|3|3|4|3|8|2.1|Big, coarse-laced white head; clear, light copper body. Sourish straw aroma with hints of rubber. Sweetish, rounded taste of faint malts which goes sourish and metallic bitter in the aftertaste. Notes of straw. This one manages to be both smooth and unpleasant at the same time. That's quite a feat; not quite sure if this can is somehow gone bad. Not sure how, though. Sunlight doesn't affect cans, and exposing them to heat in Norway in January is non-trivial. (0.5l can; BBF date 2006-10-02.)|1/30/2006 4:32:16 PM|Norway||Bergen|Pilsener
12116|Falcons Julmumma|Carlsberg Sverige|6|4|5|3|12|3|Medium, white fine-laced head; dark red, almost black body. Strange, sweet aroma of ginger, gløgg (Norwegian mullet claret), and cloves. Sweet ginger taste with strong notes of cardamom, cinnamon and cloves, dry aftertaste with strong cardamom taste. In fact, a bit much cardamom in the aftertaste. This is more like a soda than a beer, but not really bad. Very different.|1/29/2006 5:01:06 PM|Sweden||Falkenberg|Spice/Herb/Vegetable
10124|Pitfield Shoreditch Stout |Pitfield|6|4|6|2|12|3|Thin, dark brown head of coarse lace over a body so nearly opaque black that only the faintest hint of dark red comes through it at the edges. Tarry, burnt, faintly sourish aroma with hints of chocolate. Thin, sourish, burnt taste with faint hoppy notes. An OK stout, but not too interesting, a bit lacking in complexity.|1/28/2006 4:50:23 PM|England|Essex|Epping|Stout
15896|La Barberie India Pale Ale|La Barberie|6|4|4|2|9|2.5|Huge very coarse white head, hazy brown body. Fruity, caramelly malty aroma with citrusy hop notes and some cardboard. Taste is disturbed by excessive carbonation. Taste is sourish and smoky, with a bitter, smoky aftertaste. Something ash-like in the mouthfeel. Another dud from La Barberie, I'm afraid. They must be my least-favourite brewery; good thing this was the last of the LB bottles.|1/28/2006 3:14:37 PM|Canada|Quebec|Québec City|India Pale Ale (IPA)
690|Boddingtons Pub Ale (Can)|Samlesbury (InBev UK)|5|5|6|4|12|3.2|Medium, white, creamy head with some larger bubbles atop light brown body. Faint, mellow, fruity aroma with soapy notes. Mild, sweetish, malty taste with a nicely bitter, rounded aftertaste with notes of fruit. Mouthfeel is initially creamy, then more watery. Bitterness lingers. A decent bitter. (0.5l can.)|1/28/2006 2:21:11 PM|England|Lancashire|Preston|Bitter
6862|De Dolle Stille Nacht|De Dolle Brouwers|7|4|8|5|16|4|Big, off-white, creamy head; hazy dark orange body. Sweet vinous aroma with overtones of bread, yeast, and citrus. Powerful, sweet, vinous taste of lemon and spice, with a spicy, dry aftertaste, which lingers. Noticeable alcohol warmth.  A great beer!|1/28/2006 1:38:08 PM|Belgium||Diksmuide|Belgian Strong Ale
528|Brooklyn Lager|Brooklyn Brewery|7|3|6|3|13|3.2|Small white coarse-laced head shrinks to a thin white ring. Hazy light brown body. Sweet, fruity, caramelly aroma with strong citrus hop profile. Malty, bitter taste, somewhat watery. Bitterness with fruity notes lingers. A very good, and quite untypical, dark lager.|1/28/2006 1:31:08 PM|United States|New York|Brooklyn|Vienna

Fruity, lemony aroma with hints of coriander and perhaps some caraway.Taste is surprisingly full and malty with hints of wheat. Aftertaste is bitter. Mouthfeel somewhat watery. Some off flavours. Quite unusual, OK, but not too exciting.|1/28/2006 1:27:11 PM|Poland||Zywiec|Pale Lager

Sourish aroma with hints of cinnamon and spices, and some caramel. Deep, sweet lager taste of cinnamon and faintly roasted malts. Quite good, but nothing exceptional.|1/27/2006 10:40:48 AM|Sweden||Vimmerby|Dunkler Bock

Deep, sweet aroma of red wine, yeast, and bread with notes of alcohol and paint. Deep, extremely sweet alcohol fruity, melony taste. Intense, reminiscent of mulled red wine. Bitter, sweet aftertaste. Notes of apples. A glorious beer. (2005 bottle, drank January 2006. Have tried 7- and 13-year old bottles before, which were among my best tasting experiences ever.)|1/27/2006 10:37:46 AM|England|Devon|Exeter|Barley Wine
37652|Great Divide Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout   |Great Divide Brewing Company|9|5|8|4|18|4.4|Medium dark brown creamy head with larger bubbles. Utterly opaque black body. Deep, sweet aroma of burnt licorice, coffee, and wild berries, with notes of bread and oil. Very harmonic; I could just sit and smell this for ever. Deep, sweet, burnt taste of chocolate, hops, and roastiness. Burnt marzipan flavours linger. Huge amounts of hops can be detected, but they blend in nicely with the rest. Caramel, nicely, vaguely burnt. Velvety, oily, seductive mouthfeel. Mellow. Lovely! Fantastic! One of the best beers I've had.|1/27/2006 10:33:27 AM|United States|Colorado|Denver|Imperial Stout
26369|Pitfield 1837 India Pale Ale|Pitfield|6|4|6|3|13|3.2|Medium, off-white, creamy head with larger bubbles. Hazy brown body. Powerful orangey, medicinal hop aroma. Bitter, meaty taste of medicine and hints of oranges with faintly roasted flavours in the background. Considerable alcohol taste in the aftertaste. Also quite a bit of sweetness. It&#8217;s good, but not great. The medicine detracts a bit from it. A very strange beer. Historically interesting. (0.5l bottle, first from the Pitfield Street shop, second time from City Beverage Co, London.)|1/27/2006 10:30:31 AM|England|Essex|Epping|English Strong Ale
16186|3 Fonteinen Beersel Tarwebier|3 Fonteinen|6|3|6|2|12|2.9|Small, white, coarse-laced white head, Clear, dark yellow body. Looks like a pilsener. Sourish, wheaty aroma with a hint of strawberries. Taste is sweet and wheaty with notes of cinnamon and a dry strawberry-like aftertaste. Very difficult to place this beer. Very unusual, and interesting, but didn't really appeal to me.  (0.33l bottle; I *think* this is the Tarwebier, but it's hard to know, since no name is given on the bottle. Wheat is listed among the ingredients, though.)|1/27/2006 10:28:10 AM|Belgium||Beersel|Belgian White (Witbier)
17845|Primátor Premium Dark (Tmavý Lezák)|Pivovar Náchod (LIF)|6|4|6|3|14|3.3|Small, creamy, tan head with larger bubbles. Dark, red brown body. Burnt, sooty, sweet aroma with the smallest hint of mints and notes of smoke. Burnt, sooty taste with some sweetness and, again, smoke. Somewhat bitter. Sooty, burnt notes linger. Good, but a little one-dimensional. (0.33l bottle labeled &quot;premium dark; brewery web site indicates it's this beer.)|1/27/2006 10:20:25 AM|Czech Republic||Náchod|Dunkel
22904|Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA|Dogfish Head Brewery|7|4|7|5|16|3.9|Smallish, coarse-laced white head; clear, light brown body. Massive, caramelly marzipan aroma. (Hmmm. No hops. Strange.) Deep, very sweet taste, with sugary, oily mouthfeel, and a very subtle hop profile. Aftertaste is bitter with roasted almonds. Roasted almonds linger. Disappointing that there's so little aroma hops here. Almost like drinking a cake. Perfect with dessert. A very good beer, but not what I expected. (Beer produced April 2005, consumed December 2006. 0.33l bottle.)|1/27/2006 10:10:58 AM|United States|Delaware|Milton|American Strong Ale 
29208|Bièropholie IPA|Bièropholie|6|4|6|3|14|3.3|Smallish, light beige, normal head over chestnut brown body, vaguely hazy at the bottom of the bottle. Deep, sweet, malty aroma with caramel and cardboard notes. (Possible that the beer is a bit old.) Bitter, malty taste with roasty, hoppy aftertaste; malt somewhat toffee-like. Burnt toast lingering. Good, and interesting, but not great.|1/27/2006 10:07:48 AM|Canada|Quebec||India Pale Ale (IPA)
13391|Fantôme La Gourmande|Brasserie Fantôme|8|5|6|3|14|3.6|Huge, coarse-laced, off-white head. Bronze body with ongoing carbonation and some bubbles. Aroma dominated by lemon with a Belgian yeast profile behind it, together with mysterious spices. Excellent aroma, and very mysterious. Taste is deep and intense, again lots of lemon, somewhat sourish and salt-like, reminiscent of soap. The lemon is a little cloying, and before we pour the yeast in the body is a bit thin. Spicy taste lingers. Actually, this is in some ways reminiscent of a lambic. Taste is a little cloying and overdone. Still, an interesting beer, quite good. (0.75l bottle.)|1/27/2006 10:04:42 AM|Belgium||Soy-Erezée|Saison
7357|Thisted Limfjords Porter/Double Brown Stout|Thisted Bryghus|7|5|7|4|15|3.8|Small, tan, normal-laced head. Opaque black body. Dense licorice aroma with faint notes of wild berries and coffee. Dense, powerful taste much like the aroma, bitter, burnt aftertaste with lingering coffee taste. Sweetish. More of a stout, IMHO, but still very good. Perhaps a bit lacking in complexity.|1/25/2006 2:35:10 PM|Denmark||Thisted|Baltic Porter
3948|Grimbergen Blonde|Alken-Maes (Heineken)|6|4|7|4|15|3.6|Medium, white, coarse head. Clear copper body. Faint aroma of licorice and apples. Deep, sourish taste of again apples with notes of licorice. Quite bitter. Dry, sweetish aftertaste. Complex, yet light and refreshing. Very good!|1/25/2006 2:31:15 PM|Belgium||Jumet|Belgian Ale
13770|Baltika 8 Pshenichnoe (Wheat)|Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg)|5|3|6|4|13|3.1|Big white fine-bubbled head, shrinks slowly over a hazy dirty yellow body. Sourish aroma of banana and apples. Sourish, deep taste of dusty grain, notes of banana, with lemony, spicy, bitter aftertaste. Round, mealy mouthfeel. Light, refreshing, and spicy with some character.|1/25/2006 2:26:42 PM|Russia||St. Petersburg|German Hefeweizen

4563|La Trappe Dubbel|De Koningshoeven (Bavaria - Netherlands)|7|3|7|4|15|3.6|Dark red body under a thin white ring of foam. Sweet licorice aroma with notes of anise, bread, and toffee, as well as some banana. Deep, strong, sweet taste of sourish wild berries (huh?), marzipan (just said it was sourish, didn't I?), and licorice. Aftertaste is vaguely bitter and roasty, with lingering sweetness. Some alcohol is detectable. A good dubbel, although perhaps a bit weak.|1/23/2006 3:29:54 PM|Netherlands||Berkel-Enschot|Abbey Dubbel
10078|Erdinger Weissbier Alkoholfrei|Erdinger Weissbräu|5|3|5|3|11|2.7|Big, white, coarse head shrinks quickly, leaving thick lace. Hazy, pale yellow body. Aroma of straw and noble hops. Taste is again straw, some grain, and a nice hop profile. Aftertaste is sweetish and milky, with faint banana notes. For a low-alcohol this is not at all bad.|1/23/2006 3:26:44 PM|Germany|Bavaria|Erding|Low Alcohol
824|Caffreys |Coors UK (MolsonCoors)|5|5|6|3|13|3.2|Off-white milky medium-sized head over clear red-brown body. Weak fruity aroma with notes of apples. Taste is mild, very fruity, and quite bitter, some notes of nuts and marzipan. Aftertaste just fades away. Mouthfeel is milky. Not at all bad. I could drink lots and lots of this.|1/22/2006 3:31:28 PM|England|Staffordshire|Burton-upon-Trent|Bitter
9508|Mack Isbjørn|Mack Bryggeri|5|2|6|4|12|2.9|Medium, white, coarse-laced head shrinks quickly into a thin foam cover on a pale yellow body with some ongoing carbonation. Faint floral hop aroma with notes of freshly sawed wood. Taste is lots of floral hops, somewhat bitter, with the same wooden notes towards the end. Very light, and clean-tasting, and entirely dominated by the hops. Easily the best Norwegian Pilsener I&#8217;ve had. This is quite good, thanks to the hops.|1/22/2006 2:20:54 PM|Norway||Tromsø|Pale Lager
24672|Borg Pilsner|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|4|2|5|3|10|2.4|Small white coarse-laced head, which quickly subsides. Pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Faintly sourish aroma, barely detectable. Faint, malty, grassy taste with metallic hops at the end. Not that much taste, but at least there's nothing off. In a word: boring.|1/21/2006 6:13:10 PM|Norway||Bergen|Pilsener
7932|Cerveja Super Bock|Unicer Bebidas|3|2|5|3|11|2.4|Medium, white, coarse-laced head, which quickly shrinks. Pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Faint sweetish aroma with notes of smoke (uh?!?) and vegetables. Taste is straw and strong grassy hops with fruity notes. Bitter metal aftertaste. For an industrial lager, this has some character, but it's not really that good; the hops are definitely the best part.|1/21/2006 6:08:33 PM|Portugal||Balio|Pale Lager
13520|Nordlands Pils|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|5|3|5|3|11|2.7|Medium, white, coarse-laced head over clear pale yellow body. Sweetish, grassy aroma with notes of butter. Mild, malty taste with notes of grass and apple, with a faintly bitter, soft aftertaste. Not at all bad, but mostly devoid of taste, and so boring, boring, boring.|1/21/2006 6:03:31 PM|Norway||Oslo|Pilsener
30019|Caulier Bon Secours Myrtille|Caulier|6|3|4|2|7|2.2|Big, pink, coarse-laced head which subsides quickly. Body so hazy it's almost opaque, dark purple. Strong aroma of blueberry yoghurt and marzipan, maybe also a whiff of hops. Taste is, uh, what? It's sour and bitter, and very hoppy; this drowns out the blueberries, which you can barely taste. Really bitter, and somewhat hoppy, aftertaste. The combination of hops and blueberries is really unpleasant. Well... Without the hops this might be quite good. As it is I can't even say I enjoyed it. It's unusual, but not good.|1/20/2006 5:16:06 PM|Belgium||Péruwelz|Fruit Beer
45264|von Raven Birra Scura|Mecklenburgische Brauerei Lübz (Carlsberg)|6|3|5|2|12|2.8|Smallish, normal-laced, tan head, which subsides quickly, leaving a thin half-ring of foam. Deep, dark, hazy red body. Relatively faint, sweet, oily aroma of roasted malts, marzipan, and faint noble hops. Sweet, hoppy taste of roasted malts. Carbonation in the mouth disturbs the tasting. Buttery mouthfeel. Aftertaste is bitter, roasted malts. A quite good, if somewhat watery and faint, bock. If this were more assertive it would be great.|1/20/2006 3:02:56 PM|Germany|Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Lübz|Schwarzbier
13626|San Miguel Especial|San Miguel Spain (Grupo Mahou-San Miguel - Carlsberg)|5|2|5|4|11|2.7|Medium white fine-laced head. Clear, pale golden body with ongoing carbonation. Faint aroma of noble hops. Sweetish, malty taste, quite weak. Some taste of corn, and faintly of grass. Hardly any aftertaste, just a soft rounding off. A well-made, but terribly boring pilsener.|1/20/2006 10:59:58 AM|Spain||Barcelona|Pale Lager
12305|Hansa Fatøl|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|5|2|5|3|11|2.6|Smallish white fine-laced head, subsides quickly. Clear, pale golden body with ongoing carbonation. Faint, sourish, apple-like aroma. Taste is broad and apple-like, with notes of straw. Quite bitter, with notes of noble hops. Dryish afteraste, with lingering, grassy taste. An OK pilsener, not terribly interesting. (On tap, somewhat cold.)|1/20/2006 10:50:29 AM|Norway||Bergen|Pale Lager
48|Anchor Porter|Anchor Brewing Company|7|5|6|3|16|3.7|Small, creamy, brown head. Opaque black body. Dense, sweet, harmonic aroma of licorice and coffee. Again dense, almost sourish taste of roastiness, coffee, and lingering driness with notes of wild berries. Mouthfeel somewhat watery. Lingering sweetness with marzipan notes. A very good porter, reminiscent of Sam Smith's Taddy Porter, but not as good.|1/16/2006 3:31:30 PM|United States|California|San Francisco|Porter
16042|CB Bayer|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|5|4|6|4|13|3.2|Smallish, tan, creamy lasting head with large bubbles. Dark brown body. Faint, sweet aroma of cinnamon. Deep, sweet taste of roasty caramel malts with fruity notes, quite bitter aftertaste. Cinnamon-like bitterness lingers. Off flavours linger in the form of metallic bitterness. On tap 2006-01-16, served way too cold. (Surely this can't be retired?)|1/16/2006 3:27:21 PM|Norway||Bergen|Dunkel
8600|Menabrea 150° Anniversario Ambrata|Menabrea (Forst)|5|4|5|3|13|3|Huge, creamy, white head over light brown (amber, perhaps?)  body. Sweet, malty, grainy aroma with notes of straw and fruitiness. Taste is mostly straw, with very sweet, fruity malts behind it, and a bitter aftertaste with some spice in it. Mouthfeel slightly watery. Definitely a decent beer, but not very exciting.|1/14/2006 4:19:12 PM|Italy||Biella|Vienna
11453|Wychwood Scarecrow (Bottle)|Wychwood (Marstons plc)|6|3|5|3|12|2.9|Big, offwhite, coarse-laced head which shrinks quickly. Very faintly hazy golden body with a tiny amount of carbonation going on. Faint, sweet, apple-like aroma. Sourish, apple-like taste with faintly dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel, and indeed taste, is quite watery, as like apple juice that&#8217;s been watered down a little too much. Some spice lingering in the aftertaste. Ok, quite refreshing, but nothing special, and a minus for the wateriness. |1/14/2006 3:31:02 PM|England|Oxfordshire|Witney|Premium Bitter/ESB
290|Fuller's ESB (Bottle/Keg)|Fuller's|7|4|7|4|17|3.9|Big, tan, creamy head with fine lace in the middle. Chestnut brown body. Lovely, harmonic aroma of caramel malts with citrus/pine hops and notes of pepper. Powerful, malty taste with heavy pine/citrus hop profile. Some sweetness, quite a  lot of bitterness. Bitter, lingering aftertaste. Excellent! Probably the best bitter I've had.|1/14/2006 2:40:11 PM|England|Greater London|London|Premium Bitter/ESB
18630|Grans Juleøl 4.7%|Grans Bryggeri|5|3|5|3|12|2.8|Medium tan fine-bubbled head; darkish brown-red body. Sweet malty aroma with fruity cinnamon notes. Sweet, mild, malty taste with cinnamon taste lingering. Somwehat watery mouthfeel, faint notes of butter and other off tastes. Aftertaste mildly dry. An OK Christmas beer.|1/13/2006 4:57:23 PM|Norway||Sandefjord|Vienna
36464|Grans Lyst Øl|Grans Bryggeri|1|3|2|2|3|1.1|Medium, off-white head, which looks nice until the whole thing collapses into a thin white ring. Copper body. Ghastly aroma of wet cardboard, burnt rubber, and metal. Is this bottle off? Taste is like the aroma, with less emphasis on the burnt rubber. Quite bitter, although there&#8217;s no proper aftertaste. Some sweet maltiness as well. This is just incredibly poor. How can there be a market for this? I grant you most people don&#8217;t care about beer, but burnt rubber should make anyone take notice. Claims to be brewed according to the purity law, which makes the aroma and taste of this quite a feat. What do you think? Is it the malt or the hops that give us the burnt rubber taste? Or perhaps the water? Blechhh.|1/13/2006 4:49:55 PM|Norway||Sandefjord|Pale Lager
1092|Singha|Boon Rawd Brewery|5|2|5|4|12|2.8|Hardly any head; what's there is white. Light golden body. Hardly any aroma; faint traces of sweetness only. Sweet, light malty taste with nicely dry aftertaste. Some fruitiness and spice. Light, refreshing. Typical, industrial south-east Asian industrial lager.|1/13/2006 4:45:02 PM|Thailand||Bangkok|Premium Lager
13526|Grans Lettøl|Grans Bryggeri|4|3|2|1|3|1.3|Large, white, creamy head with lacing of larger bubbles. Body is copper brown.  Aroma is very faint; some hops and butter, notes of caramel. Taste is thin and sourish with a strong metallic bitter taste of caramel and cardboard with notes of straw. Metallic bitterness lingers. Wow! This really sucks in a completely new way. I&#8217;ve never had a beer this bad before. The best I can say about it is that it could be worse.  I would definitely prefer water over this.|1/13/2006 10:36:22 AM|Norway||Sandefjord|Low Alcohol
23916|Poretti Bock Rossa|Carlsberg Italia|6|3|5|3|12|2.9|Smallish white head of small bubbles, subsides quickly, leaving traces of lace on the glass. Body is clear brown with a red tinge. Sweet aroma of caramel with fruity and faintly roasty notes. Taste is very sweet and malty, again caramel with some roastiness. The fruity, apple-like, taste is still there, but doesn't fit in too well. Faintly bitter aftertaste, which goes slightly dry and metallic, with the dryness lingering. Had this at cellar temperature, but it's probably more harmonic at room temperature. The metallic bitterness bothers me, but otherwise it's not bad.|1/12/2006 4:46:14 PM|Italy||Lainate|Dunkler Bock
43781|Lysholmer Pure Low Carb|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|5|3|4|2|7|2.1|Medium, white head of small bubbles, subsides quickly. Light copper body with occassional bubbles floating upwards. Sweet, fruity aroma with notes of alcohol and apple. Taste is very like the aroma, but with more emphasis on the apple, and the aftertaste has metallic bitterness. Very watery mouthfeel. Metallic bitterness lingers. It wasn't so bad to begin with, but as I keep drinking I like it less and less. If you want to stay slim I suggest giving up food instead of switching from real beer to this.|1/12/2006 2:17:54 PM|Norway||Oslo|Pale Lager
51342|Seidel Alkoholfritt Øl |Aass Bryggeri|5|3|5|3|13|2.9|Big, white creamy head subsides slowly, leaving stray strange lacing on the glass. Clear copper body. Harmonic aroma of straw, some caramel malts, and noble hops. The straw is quite prominent, but somehow without really being offensive. Taste is sweet straw with strong noble hop notes, and some vegetable notes. Some metal in the aftertaste, relatively bitter. For a non-alcoholic beer this is not at all bad. In fact, I quite like it. Probably the best Norwegian beer in this category, actually. Had this only lightly chilled, which is probably a good idea.|1/12/2006 12:00:36 PM|Norway||Drammen|Low Alcohol
24392|Seidel Pils|Aass Bryggeri|5|3|4|2|8|2.2|Medium, white, fine-laced head over pale yellow body. Very faint aroma, in which noble hops can just be made out, together with something else that doesn't seem too promising. Taste is watery initially, but quickly develops into a quite strongly hoppy taste, with strong off flavours. Cardboard, wet straw, and bitterness can be made out. Aftertaste is bitter. The hops seem OK, maybe noble, but they drown in the off flavours. This was decidedly unpleasant.|1/11/2006 3:40:29 PM|Norway||Drammen|Pilsener
53553|Grans Bare Lys Julepils|Grans Bryggeri|4|3|4|2|8|2.1|Small, white, fine-bubbled head which quickly subsides. Light chestnut brown body. Faint caramel aroma with cardboard and hop notes. Taste is mostly cardboard, with some caramel malts, and a buttery aftertaste. Mouthfeel is watery. Dry, empty aftertaste, with the unpleasant butter notes lingering. This is like the ghost of a Christmas beer. Quite unpleasant. Would not recommend this to anyone for anything.|1/11/2006 3:01:37 PM|Norway||Sandefjord|Premium Lager
12543|Oslo Porter|Oslo Mikrobryggeri|6|4|5|3|13|3.1|Medium, quickly subsiding white fine-laced head. Translucent dark red body. Floral hops aroma, with some resin. Taste is not too heavy, with a strong hop kick, very bitter. Dry, malty, hoppy aftertaste with burnt and resin notes. A bit too bitter for this little taste, I think. Not bad, but not their best. (On tap @ OMB.)|1/11/2006 2:26:48 PM|Norway||Oslo|Porter
24950|Oslo Chief Imperial Stout|Oslo Mikrobryggeri|5|5|7|4|16|3.7|Largish, creamy, off-white head which lasts forever. Body is black and only the faintest hints of red can be spotted through it. A very good-looking beer. Faint, roasty aroma. Taste is faint to begin with, then goes all coffee, burnt toast, charcoal and faint smoky notes. Very dry. Hops can be detected, but only just. Burnt flavours linger. This is more like an Irish stout than an imperial, IMHO. Anyway, a very good stout. (On tap @ OMB.)|1/11/2006 2:22:38 PM|Norway||Oslo|Imperial Stout
41295|Oslo Juleøl|Oslo Mikrobryggeri|6|4|6|3|12|3.1|Served ice cold; had to warm it manually. Medium offwhite head; deep, dark and faintly hazy body with carbonation. Sweetish licorice aroma with metallic, resiny hops. Taste is again resiny hops followed by roasty, burnt malts. Watery mouthfeel made chewy by the carbonation. Aftertaste is powdery, dry malts and bitterness. Acidic with notes of wild berries. This is OK, but not really a Christmas beer. Taste elements are OK, but the combination is not that great. (0.5l on tap.)  (Previous rating 2006-01-11: 6/4/6/3/15. Average, creamy off-white head over hazy red translucent body. Harmonic aroma of caramel malts and floral hops with pine notes. Sweet malty flavour quickly followed by a nice, dry aftertaste that&#8217;s malty, slightly sourish, and very hoppy. Very bitter for a Christmas beer. Hoppy, dry aftertaste lingers. Quite good, and quite interesting. (On tap @ OMB.))|1/11/2006 2:18:05 PM|Norway||Oslo|English Strong Ale
53556|Oslo Økologisk Ale|Oslo Mikrobryggeri|5|3|6|3|14|3.1|Small creamy white head on clear copper body with some ongoing carbonation. Light, floral hoppy aroma with notes of pine. Taste is again light, and mostly floral hops, somwhat bitter, with a kind of golden sweetness to the hop taste. No real aftertaste. Not at all bad, but perhaps a little boring.  (On tap @ OMB.)|1/11/2006 2:13:47 PM|Norway||Oslo|Bitter
18638|Grans Julebrygg|Grans Bryggeri|5|3|6|4|14|3.2|Biggish light brown coarse-laced head over dark red body. Head subsides quickly. Caramel, cinnamon, and butter aroma; slightly off. Rounded, sweet, harmonic taste of roasted caramel with softly dry cinnamon aftertaste. Peppery cinnamon flavours linger. Mouthfeel vaguely buttery. Definitely tastes better than it smells. Probably the best of the Norwegian budget Christmas beers. Actually quite close to a 7 for flavour. Definitely possible to sip this and enjoy it.|1/9/2006 4:35:55 PM|Norway||Sandefjord|Vienna
52828|Gulden Draak Vintage|Brouwerij Van Steenberge|6|5|6|3|14|3.4|Big, tan, creamy fine-laced head; hazy dark red-brown body. Vague aroma of burnt caramel and bread, maybe some syrup as well. Harmonic taste of bread, paradise seeds, and some caramel. Not that much taste, really. Bitter aftertaste. Oily mouthfeel. Good, but quite boring. Had enormous expectations for this, as I'm a big GD fan. Maybe it needs to be stored for some years? If so, why make it look like a Christmas beer? Weird.|1/8/2006 5:56:17 PM|Belgium||Ertvelde|Belgian Strong Ale
8837|Ommegang Hennepin|Brewery Ommegang (Moortgat)|6|4|7|3|15|3.5|0.75l bottle. Cork exploded out of the bottle, followed by foaming beer. By the time we'd poured and cleaned up the head was small and white. Hazy yellow body. Sweet banana and bubblegum aroma, with spicy notes. Taste is spicy paradise seeds and pepper with banana notes and dry noble hops. Good, but not that good.|1/8/2006 5:53:25 PM|United States|New York|Cooperstown|Saison
48719|La Rulles Estivale|Brasserie Artisanale de Rulles|8|4|6|3|15|3.6|Huge, white head leaving coarse lace; deep copper body with ongoing carbonation. Deep aroma of citrusy hops (cascade?!?) and fruity yeast notes; also detectable are resin/pine notes. Bitter, malty taste with slightly oily mouthfeel. Grapefruity bitterness. Not much body. Vert good, but could do with more body. Quite refreshing. (Beginning to suspect that Biere de Garde and Saison are just not my beer styles.)|1/8/2006 5:50:28 PM|Belgium||Rulles|Belgian Ale
44821|Bièropholie MacKroken Flower|Bièropholie|8|4|8|4|17|4.1|Medium fine-laced light brown head over deep dark red body through which light can just barely make it. Powerful sweet aroma of molasses and syrup with notes of coffee, oil, and wild berries. Aroma also somewhat bread-like. Taste is faintly sourish molasses with notes of wild berries and burnt syrup. Aftertaste is peppery coffee with oily hop notes. Alcohol heat lingers in the mouth. This is a great beer! Like a powerful imperial stout, but with more flavour. Especially the berry-like notes really make this stand out from your normal imperial stout. How they can call this a scotch ale is beyond me.|1/7/2006 6:12:44 PM|Canada|Quebec||Scotch Ale
7324|Gavroche|St. Sylvestre|6|3|6|4|15|3.4|Big, fine-laced, off-white head, over hazy light red-brown body. Aroma of spice and honey with notes of pepper, earth, and caramel. Big taste with lots of spice and caramel, plus some paradise seeds, somewhat sweet, quite bitter. Rounded aftertaste. Quite good, but a bit boring for a Belgian.|1/7/2006 4:32:18 PM|France||St. Sylvestre-Cappel|Bière de Garde
13387|Frydenlund Pilsener|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|4|2|4|2|7|1.9|Coarse lace above somewhat creamy, white, medium-sized head. Clear copper body. Aroma is standard Ringnes caramel malts with some butter. Taste is buttery caramel with skunked hops (from a can!). Some bitterness, but no proper aftertaste. This is very, very poor.  Has to be one of the worst pilseners I've had. Ringnes must really hate the memory of Frydenlund.|1/7/2006 3:23:05 PM|Norway||Oslo|Pilsener
12893|Lysholmer Spesialøl|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|5|2|5|3|10|2.5|Medium-sized white head; deep copper body. Faint, fruity aroma of apple, caramel and a little noble hops. Taste is more apple with notes of grain, water, and maybe a little butter. No detectable aftertaste. A very faintly off taste with corn notes lingers. Well. Boring is the best I can say.|1/7/2006 2:21:13 PM|Norway||Oslo|Pale Lager
9425|Ringnes Pilsener|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|5|2|5|3|8|2.3|Quickly subsiding smallish white creamy head with some larger bubbles sits over clear copper body. Faint aroma of caramel malts with some notes of butter and almond brittle. Taste is more of the same, with perhaps more focus on the almond brittle and a quite definite noble hops taste. Mouthfeel somewhat watery. Slightly off aftertaste, which is somewhat bitter. Not that good, or really that bad. Boring, and faintly bad. The bad taste lingers afterwards, which lost it two points off the overall.|1/7/2006 1:33:41 PM|Norway||Oslo|Pilsener
26582|La Barberie Stout Impériale|La Barberie|6|5|4|2|7|2.4|Big, creamy, dark brown, almost black, head. Body is completely opaque, even at the edges. Dense, sweetish aroma of burnt cofee with signuature notes I recognize from other la Barberie beers. The taste is strange, sourish, smoky, and burnt, with an oddly buttery mouthfeel. Quite bitter. Aftertaste has a grapefruit-like taste. Very odd experience. Initially I didn't like it at all, then I gradually got happier with it, but towards the end I thought it absolutely vile. My conclusion is still that this is not a good beer. The best I can say is that it's definitely unusual, and clearly not boring.|1/6/2006 5:00:26 PM|Canada|Quebec|Québec City|Imperial Stout
2329|Aass Pilsner|Aass Bryggeri|5|3|5|3|11|2.7|Big white fine-laced head, clear copper body. Soft, faintly spicy floral hop aroma. Taste is initially caramel malts, followed by floral hops and apples. Dry, papery, mealy aftertaste with a grassy bitterness is the lowest point of the beer. Not the most exciting Pilsner, but decent. (0.5l can.)|1/6/2006 4:56:19 PM|Norway||Drammen|Pilsener
14989|Aass Ice Beer|Aass Bryggeri|5|2|5|3|10|2.5|Smallish, normal-laced white head, which subsides quite quickly. Pale copper body with some solitary bubbles floating upwards. Hardly any aroma; can faintly detect some caramel malts, but that's it. Very faint and watery taste; only in the aftertaste can a vague malt and hop taste be detected. Very, very boring.|1/5/2006 4:37:59 PM|Norway||Drammen|Pale Lager
4689|Aass Fatøl|Aass Bryggeri|6|3|6|4|13|3.2|Big head of fine lace, pale copper body with some ongoing carbonation. Nice aroma of pine-like hops, with notes of metal and grain.  Crisp, clean taste of caramel malts; soft aftertaste of pine-like hops. Not that much taste to this one, but what there is is very clean and nice; for a Norwegian lager this is pretty good.|1/5/2006 4:14:38 PM|Norway||Drammen|Pale Lager
14987|Aass Sommerøl|Aass Bryggeri|6|3|6|3|12|3|Biggish creamy white head over pale yellow body. Acidic, refreshing aroma with fruity notes and some grain. Taste is apple-like with some light malts. Aftertaste is very light bitterness with some straw. Not at all bad; in fact, probably the best Norwegian &quot;summer beer&quot;. A decent light lager. (0.5l can.)|1/5/2006 4:12:54 PM|Norway||Drammen|Pilsener
9422|Dahls Pils|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|6|3|6|4|14|3.3|Biggish, creamy white head with larger bubbles; very pale yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Faint aroma of apple and some noble hops. Taste is more apple, faintly sourish, and very soft aftertaste with slightly metallic hops. One of the better Norwegian pilseners.|1/3/2006 3:31:35 PM|Norway||Oslo|Pilsener
12814|Frydenlund Bayerøl|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|5|3|5|3|10|2.6|Small, white, coarse head; brown body. Faint aroma of roasty caramel and some grain. Grainy, watery taste of caramel and straw, and something else that shouldn't be there. Hardly any aftertaste. Very disappointing. A bayer should taste more than this, and the off flavour is disappointing, too.|1/1/2006 6:27:14 AM|Norway||Oslo|Dunkel
1143|Aass Classic|Aass Bryggeri|6|3|6|4|15|3.4|Medium, creamy, white head; light bronze body. Aroma of noble hops with notes of grain, straw, and, faintly, apple. Taste of apple and wood, with soft aftertaste of noble hops. For a Norwegian pilsener this is great.|1/1/2006 6:23:38 AM|Norway||Drammen|Vienna
12420|Frydenlund Juleøl 6.5%|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|6|3|6|4|14|3.3|Small, tan, quickly dissipating head. Darkish red body. Light, harmonic sweet aroma with notes of cinnamon and caramel. Arojma could be stronger. Sweet cinnamon taste, with nice, lightly dry aftertaste. Faint roasted notes lingering. A nice christmas beer, if somewhat on the light side.|12/30/2005 5:32:06 AM|Norway||Oslo|Dunkler Bock
11257|Dahls Juleøl 6.5%|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|6|3|6|3|13|3.1|Small tan head, dissipates quickly. Dark translucent red body. Sweet, dense aroma of caramel and notes of wild berries, with some cinnamon. Broad, very sweet taste of cinnamon and roasted malts, with some caramel. Faint, slightly dry aftertaste with lingering burnt cinnamon taste. Quite good, but perhaps a bit too sweet.|12/30/2005 5:29:01 AM|Norway||Oslo|Dunkler Bock
13525|Grans Premium Pilsner|Grans Bryggeri|5|3|4|2|8|2.2|Medium coarse-laced white head; clear straw-yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Sweet aroma of wet straw and faint caramel with metallic hoppy notes. Sweet caramel straw taste; aftertaste has bitter aspects, as well as overtones of earth and metal. Not really very pleasant.|12/30/2005 5:26:41 AM|Norway||Sandefjord|Pilsener
14268|CB Juleøl 6.5%|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|5|3|6|3|13|3|No head (probably because of glass). Brown body with ongoing carbonation. Very faint aroma, hard to detect what is there. Strong taste of roasted malts, followed by powerful hop aroma. Aftertaste is dry and roasty. Not at all bad, with the hops clearly being the best part.|12/30/2005 5:24:14 AM|Norway||Bergen|Dunkler Bock
5846|RCH Old Slug Porter|RCH|8|5|6|3|15|3.7|Big beige head of coarse lace on dark red almost opaque body. Sweet harmonic coffee aroma with licorice, pepper, and pine notes. Sweet, smoky, burnt taste; aftertaste is a strange combination of driness, bitterness, soot, and coffee. Strangely thin mouthfeel. The sooty bitterness doesn't really do it for me, but definitely a quality brew.|12/20/2005 2:53:54 PM|England|Somerset|Weston-super-Mare|Porter
1264|Ringwood XXXX Porter|Ringwood (Marstons plc)|7|5|6|4|15|3.7|Tan, creamy head with larger bubbles, deep dark red body. Deep sweet aroma with notes of pepper and coffee and some alcohol. Lovely, sweet, firm taste of wild berries, coffee, and slight sourness. Slightly, oily mouthfeel. Fruity, dry, somewhat bitter, peppery aftertaste. Burnt flavours linger. Excellent, but could do with less of the sourness.|12/18/2005 1:55:55 PM|England|Hampshire|Ringwood|Porter
28431|Nøgne Ø Porter|Nøgne Ø|7|4|7|4|16|3.8|Biggish brown head. Nearly opaque dark brown body. Roasty coffeeish aroma with hoppy oily rye notes. Dry-sweetish taste, with an acidic edge, of burnt sooty rye with vaguely citric hop notes. Very harmonic and balanced. Full-bodied. Soft mouthfeel. Dry delicate burnt aftertaste with grainy chocolatey notes. Burnt notes linger. Very, very good and highly drinkable. Grew on me as I drank. &#40;0.5l bottle, Wine monopoly, Oslo.&#41;|12/18/2005 8:48:16 AM|Norway||Grimstad|Porter
23901|Nøgne Ø Amber Ale|Nøgne Ø|6|4|6|3|14|3.3|Offwhite, coarse medium head of quickly shrinking foam over slightly hazy light red-brown body. Aroma of lightly roasted malts with notes of wood and traces of citrusy hops. Sourish, oily taste of bitterness. Not that much taste; essentially dominated by the citrusy hops. Lacking in body. Dry aftertaste. Not really up to usual NØ standard.|12/18/2005 8:45:41 AM|Norway||Grimstad|Amber Ale
835|Orval|Brasserie dOrval|8|4|7|4|15|3.8|Offwhite, creamy medium head with larger bubbles. Hazy pale orange-red body with ongoing carbonation. Eccentric aroma that is a harmonic vinuous blend of caramel and earth. Sourish metal taste with some bitterness and notes of stale hops. Slightly watery. Aftertaste simply disappears. Refreshing, but I have to admit that this is a world classic I don't really enjoy that much.|12/18/2005 8:43:01 AM|Belgium||Florenville - Villers-d.-Orval|Belgian Ale
10380|La Trappe Blond|De Koningshoeven (Bavaria - Netherlands)|7|3|6|3|14|3.3|Medium white head, quickly subsiding. Clear orange body. Sweet vinuous banana-like aroma with sourish lacquer notes. Taste very like the aroma, very soft. Watery mouthfeel. Faint, lingering, peppery, banana-like flavours. No real aftertaste. Good, highly drinkable, but for a Belgian-style beer not that interesting.|12/18/2005 8:39:47 AM|Netherlands||Berkel-Enschot|Belgian Ale
303|Fuller's London Porter (Bottle/Keg)|Fuller's|4|5|7|4|17|3.7|Small, tan, creamy head; black opaque body. Faint, roasty aroma. Deep, sweet, roasty taste, leading to an aftertaste of coffee and licorice. Very harmonic and balanced; not too complex. Great!|12/12/2005 12:28:15 PM|England|Greater London|London|Porter
139|Youngs Double Chocolate Stout|Wells & Youngs|5|5|4|3|8|2.5|Tan creamy medium head with some larger bubbles. Black opaque body. Sweet aroma with notes of coffee. Deep, sweet taste of cocos with notes of bitter chocolate with dry cocos aftertaste. Lots of taste, but the chocolate really makes it very unpleasant for me. Really did not enjoy this, even if it has lots of taste.|12/12/2005 12:24:12 PM|England|Bedfordshire|Bedford|Stout
141|Youngs Ram Rod (Pasteurised)|Wells & Youngs|4|4|6|4|13|3.1|Medium, creamy, white head with larger bubbles. Clear brown body. Faint nutty aroma. Sweet, nutty taste with resiny, citrusy hop notes. Soft, dry aftertaste with notes of resin and pine needles. Quite drinkable, but nothing special.|12/12/2005 12:21:06 PM|England|Bedfordshire|Bedford|Premium Bitter/ESB
25540|Youngs Champion|Wells & Youngs|4|4|6|5|14|3.3|Medium, creamy, white head with larger bubbles over clear yellow body. Thin hop aroma. Taste of sourish malts with resiny hops and softly bitter aftertaste. Pine needles. Quite good, highly drinkable.|12/12/2005 12:19:50 PM|England|Bedfordshire|Bedford|Golden Ale/Blond Ale
18566|Youngs Christmas Pudding Ale|Wells & Youngs|6|4|6|4|13|3.3|Offwhite creamy head of medium size with larger bubbles over dark red body. Sweet aroma of anis. Sweet malty taste with overpowering cocos flavour. Quite bitter. Dry, sharp aftertaste of cocos. Interesting, but mostly a novelty beer.|12/12/2005 12:15:44 PM|England|Bedfordshire|Bedford|English Strong Ale
140|Youngs Special London Ale|Wells & Youngs|7|4|8|5|16|4|Medium creamy white head over light brown clear body. Aroma of citrusy pine hops so harmoniously blended with sweet caramel malts that the two can hardly be told apart. Deep, sweet, malty taste of nuts, combined with bitterness, citrus, and pine needles. Soft, bitter aftertaste. Glorious! World class! It's really the EKG hops that make this one.|12/12/2005 12:11:34 PM|England|Bedfordshire|Bedford|English Strong Ale
44390|Youngs Special (Cask)|Wells & Youngs|5|4|6|4|13|3.2|Thin, coarse-laced white head on light brown body. Faint sourish aroma of resin and pine and green peas. Sweetish, light, clean taste of resin and pine, with a soft, dry finish. Very drinkable, quite good. (Cask at the Britannia.)|12/12/2005 12:09:03 PM|England|Bedfordshire|Bedford|Bitter
44453|Youngs Winter Warmer (Cask)|Wells & Youngs|5|4|6|4|14|3.3|Thin, coarse-laced off-white head on dark red body. Faint sourish aroma of nuts and faint sweet roastiness. Taste is smooth, clean, nutty maltiness; quite bitter. Aftertaste is drily nutty, with hoppy bitterness lingering. Clearly a well-made beer, but rather subdued.

44893|Brakspear Special (Cask)|Brakspear (Refresh UK - Marstons plc)|4|3|6|4|12|2.9|Thin, coarse-laced head; dark brown body. Faint sourish aroma. Taste much like aroma: bitter, sourish, thin. Dry aftertaste, with lingering pine needles. Some wood. Not at all bad, but a little boring. (On cask at the Anglesea Arms.)|12/12/2005 12:04:34 PM|England|Oxfordshire|Witney|Bitter
53540|Highgate Fat Catz|Davenports (prev Highgate) (HWBC Ltd)|4|3|5|3|11|2.6|Thin, coarse-laced head; clear brown body. No carbonation. No aroma to speak of. Soft, sourish taste of hops, dry finish. Not very remarkable. Bitterness lingers. (Cask at the Anglesea Arms.)|12/12/2005 12:02:44 PM|England|West Midlands|Walsall|Premium Bitter/ESB
4139|Shepherd Neame Bishops Finger (Pasteurised)|Shepherd Neame|6|4|6|4|14|3.4|Small, offwhite head; brown body. Nutty, earthy aroma, with sweetish malt notes. Powerfully nutty taste, quite bitter. Ends in dry, sharp aftertaste. Roasty, pine needle notes linger. Nice, although a bit one-dimensional, and perhaps a bit too agressive for the lack of complexity.

6415|Harveys Imperial Extra Double Stout / Imperial Russian Stout|Harveys|7|4|8|4|17|4|Tiny dark brown head; black opaque body. Smell of blueberries, burnt licorice, and sourness. Taste is like aroma, but overpowering. Sticks to the inside of the mouth. Aftertaste dry, lingering version of same. Very good, but could be more complex. (2001 vintage sampled Dec 2005.)|12/12/2005 11:56:39 AM|England|East Sussex|Lewes|Imperial Stout

Some tanginess, some bitterness. Slightly dry aftertaste. Good, but not outstanding. (Strange; I've been much more excited by this before.)

Aftertaste rather dry, with citrusy/piney notes of hop (EKG?). Some sweetness. Light, drinkable, and not too boring. (On tap at White Horse.)|12/12/2005 11:45:00 AM|England|East Sussex|Lewes|Bitter
7757|Samuel Smiths Extra Stout|Samuel Smith|3|5|7|4|15|3.4|Smallish tan creamy head; opaque black body. Aroma so faint I can&#8217;t pick anything up. Dense, burnt, coffee-ish, bitter taste. Very harmonic. Faintly sourish. Taste subdued, yet complex. Very nice, and very drinkable, if not the most exciting stout I&#8217;ve had.

11152|Ringnes Extra Gold|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|5|3|6|4|13|3.1|Medium tan head; clear dark golden body. Faint, sweet malty aroma of malts, with notes of noble hops. Sweet caramel malt taste with a heavy accent on the malts. Slightly roasted malty taste; the roastiness becomes more noticeable in the aftertaste, which is quite bitter for a mass-market lager. Some noble hop aroma, but not much. Less boring, and with more body than the usual mass-market lagers. Faintly off taste lingering in the bitterness. Overall this is OK. Improves greatly as it warms.|12/7/2005 4:39:14 PM|Norway||Oslo|Strong Pale Lager/Imperial Pils
235|Black Sheep Ale (Bottle)|Black Sheep|6|5|8|5|16|4|Huge, offwhite, creamy head; clear, brown body with ongoing carbonation. Faint, harmonic aroma of resiny hops and some malts, maybe some bready notes. Taste is extremely smooth, of slightly roasted, faintly smoky malts, with a lovely, crisp aftertaste of resiny hops, and maybe some citrus hops. The taste is very balanced, and nice. Some bitterness. Not the most complex, or fancy-tasting beer I've had, but exceptionally well made, and highly drinkable. Highly recommended!|12/7/2005 4:35:32 PM|England|North Yorkshire|Ripon|Bitter
11144|Hansa Juleøl 4.5%|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|5|4|5|3|10|2.7|Tan medium head, dark red body. Faint malty aroma with notes of roastiness. Taste is quite strong, but is mostly malty caramel taste, with some sweetness. Carbonation disturbs the tasting somewhat. Watery mouthfeel. Aftertaste is dry, and the combination of bitterness and roastiness has some buttery notes to it that are quite unpleasant. Didn't like this one much.|12/4/2005 3:48:55 PM|Norway||Bergen|Vienna
19466|Fredrikstad Juleøl 6.6%|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|6|4|5|4|13|3.2|Medium white creamy head; light red body with ongoing carbonation. Light, fruity aroma, mild malts. Malty sweet caramel taste, quite light and clean, but not at all weak. A bit light on the malts for a Christmas beer, perhaps. Faint, dry aftertaste with peppery feel. Nice, but not that interesting.|12/4/2005 10:11:10 AM|Norway||Bergen|Dunkler Bock
42509|Les Frères Houblon Fontaine du Diable|Les Frères Houblon Microbrasserie|6|4|6|3|13|3.2|Huge, tan head; deep dark red body, seems clear. Weak aroma of roasted malts with faint buttery notes, some sweetness and licorice. Smoky taste that is quite sour, but doesn't seem off. Aftertaste is mostly smokiness and roasted flavour. Buttery notes and mouthfeel. Well. Not that great, but not bad, either. Grew on me as I went through the bottle (so the overall went from 12 to 13). The sourness takes some getting used to. Not sure what style this is meant to be.|12/3/2005 5:42:47 AM|Canada|Quebec|Trois-Rivieres|Old Ale
2275|Stoudts Triple|Stoudts Brewing Co.|6|3|6|3|14|3.2|Offwhite, smallish head; hazy red body. Sweet, spicy aroma of paradise seeds, stale hops, and bread, with something sharp in it. Sharp taste of paradise seeds and citrusy hops, faint roasty notes. Citrusy hops and bitterness make up the van. Quite good, but too much yeast, not enough balance, and not enough complexity.|12/3/2005 5:38:55 AM|United States|Pennsylvania|Adamstown|Abbey Tripel
7950|Mack Bok-Øl|Mack Bryggeri|5|4|5|3|11|2.8|Medium off-white head of large bubbles; clear, dark red body. Sweet malty aroma, notes of bread; faint notes of coffee. Not that much aroma. Sweet taste, with some off notes, maybe some butter. Faint bitterness, faint burntess. Not very much taste, and some of what is there isn&#8217;t entirely right. Well. It&#8217;s OK, I guess. A disappointment, this, as some of the other Mack stuff is quite good.|12/3/2005 5:34:13 AM|Norway||Tromsø|Dunkler Bock
2131|Aass Bock|Aass Bryggeri|6|5|7|4|14|3.6|Big tan, creamy head; clear dark red body. Tight, not too strong, harmonic aroma of chocolate, some coffee, and, treacle. Deep and firm taste of sweet malts, notes of chocolate and coffee, maybe burnt bread. Almost oily mouthfeel. Very nice lightly burnt aftertaste lingers on. Taste is as harmonic as the aroma. Very good, if a bit mild. This has to be easily the best Norwegian bock.|12/3/2005 5:32:10 AM|Norway||Drammen|Dunkler Bock
53069|Berentsens Julefnugg|Berentsens Brygghus|7|5|6|4|15|3.7|Tan, creamy head with lots of larger bubbles; deep dark red body, almost like red wine. Malty, bready aroma with some light burnt, coffeeish notes, some licorice, hops also faintly noticeable, but can't tell what kind. Very harmonic aroma. Taste is very like the aroma, round and slightly watery. In the aftertaste the burntness becomes much more pronounced. Aftertaste also slightly dry, with a peppery feel to it. There is hops here, but hard to detect. Very harmonic. Overall, an excellent traditional Norwegian Christmas beer, but a little bit too weak. Had it been more assertive this would have been a real winner for this style.|12/2/2005 12:26:14 PM|Norway||Egersund|Porter
50717|Berentsens Rav Amber Ale|Berentsens Brygghus|7|5|7|4|15|3.8|Big, creamy yet big-bubbled tan head; clear, dark red body. Aroma mostly citrusy hops and clean, firm malts. Taste is bitter and firm, with a roasty taste that has smoky notes in it. Some dried fruit. Quite bitter throughout, in fact, almost dry.  Very harmonic. Aftertaste is mostly fading, but roasty/smoky flavour lingers. Very nice.|12/2/2005 12:25:19 PM|Norway||Egersund|Amber Ale
14256|Hansa Lettøl|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|4|4|5|4|8|2.5|Biggish head of coarse white lace atop clear pale golden body. Aroma is thin and faint, consisting mostly of grass notes plus some hints of noble hops and pale malts. Taste is rounded pale malts with more grassy notes and perhaps some slight apple hints. Aftertaste is a combination of grain soup and metal. Bitter throughout. Why all this bitterness (the Hansa trademark) with no hop aroma? I'd happily trade all the bitterness for an equal dose of aroma. Not very good this, even there's really little actively wrong with it.|12/1/2005 11:39:02 AM|Norway||Bergen|Low Alcohol

Taste is bitter, oily, citrusy, sweet, deep and firm, with faint caramel malts. Oily, carbonated mouthfeel. Unusually deep and powerful taste for an IPA.

Roasty coffee and toffee aroma with earthy licorice notes. Dry-sweet earthy chocolatey taste with funky, faintly acidic notes. Mid-bodied. Mild, soft, smooth mouthfeel with faint heat. Dry funky earthy chocolate aftertaste with coffee and earth notes. Some alcohol, too, and a kind of strawberry chewing gum character. Quite nice and well made.

Deep firm taste of hops (citrusy, pine-like, some resin) and sweet caramel malts. Long, lingering aftertaste of hops. Broad, firm body, oily mouthfeel. Hard to separate out all the tastes here. Excellent IPA! Low on aroma, but high on taste.|11/27/2005 8:11:58 AM|United States|Delaware|Milton|Imperial/Double IPA

Sweet, firm taste with smoky notes, rather soft round the edges. Somewhat mild for an imperial stout, even a little watery. No real aftertaste, just dries up. Coffee notes linger. A good imperial stout, but not among the best.|11/27/2005 8:08:59 AM|Sweden||Nyköping|Foreign Stout

Harmonic aroma with chocolate and coffee, quite sweet, some hops. Not too powerful. Smooth, coffee taste, with peppery notes. Aftertaste is more roast coffee and driness. Impressively smooth and harmonic for a beer this powerful, but perhaps slightly boring.|11/27/2005 8:06:34 AM|United States|Pennsylvania|Adamstown|Imperial Stout
7178|North Coast Old Stock Ale |North Coast Brewing Company|8|5|8|4|17|4.2|Tan, creamy, medium head. Clear brown body with a red tinge to it. Aroma very like sherry with hop notes; firm and sweet. Deep, sweet, complex taste of caramel and sherry with coffee and licorice notes, quite bitter throughout. Round, oily mouthfeel. Aftertaste is bitter and roasty. Some alcohol heat. Lingers in the mouth. Excellent! Have put one in the cellar; really looking forward to tasting it in a few years.|11/27/2005 8:02:44 AM|United States|California|Fort Bragg|Barley Wine

Taste also has lots of banana, with other fruits thrown in, possibly some raisin, definitely some apple. Nice malts throughout. Aftertaste is faintly bitter, like grapefruit. Very nice, although not very Christmasy by Norwegian standards.|11/27/2005 6:29:16 AM|Germany|Bavaria|Kulmbach|German Hefeweizen
28268|Aass JuleFest|Aass Bryggeri|6|4|7|3|13|3.3|Big, offwhite, somewhat creamy head; deep dark red body. Sweet malty aroma with notes of straw- or grass-like hops. Taste is full of sweet malts initially, followed by sweet, caramel and chocolate malts, and relatively mild grassy hops. Overall, an OK beer. Ok for Christmas, ok for any other time. Not that interesting.|11/25/2005 4:04:10 PM|Norway||Drammen|Dunkel

Aroma certainly is interesting, if not that good. Taste is initially only bitter, but quickly followed by a deep chocolate and anise flavour. Aftertaste is dry, followed by nothing. Well. A different beer, that&#8217;s for sure, but not that good, or even interesting. I see that this is Ringnes&#8217;s attempt to do something different, but they could have tried a lot of things more interesting (or better!) than this.|11/25/2005 3:30:12 PM|Norway||Oslo|Spice/Herb/Vegetable

Deep, firm, sweet, chocolate, toffee and coffee aroma. Almost too sweet. Deep, sweet (again, I know) taste, of burnt, toffee, with chocolate overtones. Faintly watery. Fades into lingering burntness, with lots of coffee. Very nice, although too sweet, and perhaps too clinging, for a proper porter. In the end, this is quite good.|11/25/2005 2:27:40 PM|Norway||Drammen|Porter
49273|Haandbryggeriet Ardenne Blond|Haandbryggeriet (Norway)|7|3|7|4|16|3.7|Big creamy head, cloudy dirty orange body. Lovely, firm aroma of licorice (?) with a faintly sourish tinge to it. Recognize the taste as typically Belgian, even if I struggle to describe it. Taste is likewise deep and very powerful, quite spicy, and aftertaste is likewise spicy. Paradise seeds? Probably coriander. Lots of hops in the taste, but can't recognize what variety. Too much carbonation, unfortunately. Very good Belgian, even if slightly one-dimensional.|11/25/2005 2:23:54 PM|Norway||Drammen|Saison
4984|La Gauloise Brune|Brasserie Du Bocq|8|4|7|4|16|3.9|Tan, biggish head; dark red-brown body. Sweet malty aroma with winey notes, faint chocolate, and some bread. Taste also sweet, but with a lot more roastiness, some chocolate, maybe anise? Faintly dry aftertaste. Very good, if perhaps slightly watery.|11/24/2005 1:42:40 PM|Belgium||Purnode-Yvoir|Abbey Dubbel
6185|Florisgaarden Ninkeberry|Brouwerij Huyghe|8|3|7|4|16|3.8|Normall, smallish head; clear, copper body. I don't know what ninkeberry is, but this has a lovely, strong aroma of it. Sweet, fruity, very slightly tart. Taste is much like the aroma, with only a faint off tone in it. A little watery. No aftertaste to speak of. Lovely fruit beer.|11/24/2005 1:40:24 PM|Belgium||Melle|Fruit Beer
18656|Santa Clausthaler|Binding-Brauerei (Oetker Group)|5|4|5|4|9|2.7|Offwhite medium head of coarse lace on copper-brown body. Faint floral hop aroma together with some caramel and hops. Malty taste with a little sweetness and quite a bit of caramel, together with faint hop notes and a little metal. Aftertaste is mostly a lingering hop/metal flavour  in the mouth. Well. Not much of anything here. Certainly doesn't remind me of Christmas in any way. Definitely prefer the normal Clausthaler over this.|11/23/2005 12:17:47 PM|Germany|Hesse|Frankfurt|Low Alcohol
4749|Clausthaler Classic (Premium)|Binding-Brauerei (Oetker Group)|7|3|6|4|11|3.1|Medium head of coarse white lace sits atop clear, light copper-toned body. Aroma is mostly floral hops, with notes of grass and perhaps a bit of clean straw. Taste is much like the aroma, very light initially, but with some straw/caramel malts. Ends in a nice, crisp, slightly dry bitterness. Very good for a non-alcoholic beer!|11/23/2005 11:20:46 AM|Germany|Hesse|Frankfurt|Low Alcohol
2472|Erdinger Schneeweisse Winterbier|Erdinger Weissbräu|5|4|5|4|11|2.9|Huge offwhite head; cloudy dark mud-orange body with ongoing carbonation. Subtle aroma of sweetness, and possibly some spices. Not really that much aroma. Taste is mellow, clean, light, and ends in a faintly dry aftertaste with some faintly spicy notes. Mouthfeel slightly muddy. Well. This was kind of boring, if you ask me.|11/20/2005 4:04:28 PM|Germany|Bavaria|Erding|German Hefeweizen
40625|Nøgne Ø Underlig Jul|Nøgne Ø|9|5|8|4|17|4.3|Brownish, large, creamy head; black near-opaque body, with dark red visible through thinner parts of glass. Sweet aroma of pine needles, cloves, coffee, pepper, and who knows what else. Surprisingly harmonic aroma. Taste is more subdued, surprisingly, and equally harmonic (unlike last year's, I seem to recall). Coffee, citrusy hops, roasted malts, and cloves can be made out. A peppery roastiness lingers. Lovely! Definitely this year's Christmas beer!|11/20/2005 4:00:45 PM|Norway||Grimstad|Spice/Herb/Vegetable
18866|Ringnes Julebokk|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|6|5|7|4|16|3.8|Large, creamy, tan head; dark red visible through the body with some difficulty. Aroma is sweet maltiness with some hops, relatively faint. (How on earth did they brew this to 9.9%, with huge gravity, and leave no aroma? If done on purpose it requires uncommon skill, and a pretty perverse mind.) Taste is deep, round, and sweet, with notes of chocolate, coffee, and cloves. Aftertaste is dry, roasty and full of cloves and other spices. Very good. The best beer ever produced under the Ringnes label by a very long stretch.|11/20/2005 5:47:37 AM|Norway||Oslo|Doppelbock
28663|Nøgne Ø God Jul|Nøgne Ø|7|5|8|5|16|4.1|Big, creamy, off-white head; black opaque body going brownish round the edges. Subdued sweetish toffee aroma with hints of chocolate, coffee, and citrusy hops. Deep, sweet coffee taste, well rounded, ending in a nicely rounded dry, roasty aftertaste. Strong notes of citrusy hops run underneath the taste from start to finish, and is a nice contribution. Taste not that powerful, but deep and lovely. An excellent Christmas beer.|11/20/2005 5:43:43 AM|Norway||Grimstad|American Strong Ale 
996|Corsendonk Christmas Ale|Brouwerij Corsendonk|7|4|8|4|16|3.9|Huge, offwhite head over clear dark ruby body. Aroma is strong, and cool, full of sweetness, stale hops, coriander, and other spices. Taste is clean and light, initially, but quickly gives way to spices (pepper, cinnamon, and who knows what else), but the mouthfeel is a little watery (possibly because of what I had before this beer). Faintly reminiscent of wine, also has some lingering burntness. Overall a good Belgian.|11/20/2005 5:40:43 AM|Belgium||Turnhout|Belgian Strong Ale
40580|Nøgne Ø Julenatt|Nøgne Ø|9|5|7|3|15|3.9|Huge dark, tan, creamy head with some large bubbles; opaque black body. Sweet aroma with vanilla and touches of pine needles. Taste is dense and firm, with more vanilla (quite dominant, in fact), pine needles, and touches of coffee. Aftertaste is lingering driness, roastiness, and spice. Very interesting, and definitely well made,  thought I don't much care for the vanilla.|11/20/2005 5:37:15 AM|Norway||Grimstad|Porter
52948|Haandbryggeriet Nissefar|Haandbryggeriet (Norway)|8|5|7|4|16|4|Tan coarse-laced medium head topping opaque black body. Aroma of coffee and citrusy hops. Powerful, sweet, roasty taste with notes of hops, and a nicely rounded burnt dry finish. Lovely&#033; Now this is a proper Christmas beer. (This rating stinks. Need to rerate.)|11/20/2005 5:30:30 AM|Norway||Drammen|Old Ale
52874|Hansa Ekstra Vellagret Julebrygg 6.5%|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|7|4|6|3|12|3.2|Medium off-white head; clear mahogany body. Sweet malty aroma with notes of chocolate, bread, and alcohol. Nice, mellow, rounded taste of faintly musty sweet malts, ending in an aftertaste consisting mostly of spice (cinnamon?). A well-rounded Christmas beer, but not really very exciting.|11/20/2005 5:09:52 AM|Norway||Bergen|Dunkler Bock
10098|Kulmbacher Mönchshof Weihnachts Bier|Kulmbacher Brauerei (Schörghuber)|6|3|5|4|10|2.8|Medium white lace over clear golden body; looks like your normal pilsener. Good aroma of light malts, flower hops, and slight metal notes. Smells like your normal German pilsener, too. Sweet, clean, malty taste with hoppy undertones ending in a faintly dry finish. Overall pretty boring, with the hops being the best thing about it. Not a Christmas beer by Norwegian standards, but not a pilsener, either.|11/20/2005 5:06:53 AM|Germany|Bavaria|Kulmbach|Oktoberfest/Märzen
172|Sweetwater 420 Extra Pale Ale|Sweetwater Brewing Company|6|4|6|4|12|3.2|Big, coarse, white head; clear, copper-yellow body. Faint aroma of citrusy hops. Taste is clean and light, dominated by the citrus hops, with a a clear, bitter finish. An okay ale.|11/15/2005 11:05:11 AM|United States|Georgia|Atlanta|American Pale Ale
365|Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (Bottle/Can)|Sierra Nevada Brewing Company|7|3|6|3|13|3.2|Small, white, coarse head; orange body with some haziness. Aroma is lovely citrusy hops. Taste is quite bitter, and dominated by the same citrusy hops. Finish is quite dry, and the bitterness lingers in the mouth. A decent pale ale; the hops are the best part, and in fact the only one I can make out.|11/15/2005 11:03:47 AM|United States|California|Chico|American Pale Ale
158|Samuel Adams Boston Lager|Boston Beer Company|5|2|6|4|10|2.7|Clear, copper body with some ongoing carbonation. Virtually no head. Thin, cool, malt aroma with faint floral hops. Taste is clean and light, with some caramel malts, and a faintly dry finish that has a nice, floral hop profile. The hops are the best thing about this beer, which is otherwise wholly unremarkable.|11/15/2005 11:01:47 AM|United States|Massachusetts|Boston|Vienna
13388|CB Pilsner|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|6|3|5|4|11|2.9|Medium white head; pale yellow body. Faint aroma of floral hops and pale pilsener malts. Faint, but quite nice. Taste is very light and clean, with a very nicely complementing aftertaste that is faintly dry with floral hops. Some very faint metal in the aftertaste. A good pilsener, but could be a bit more assertive. (0.33l bottle.)|11/9/2005 2:48:08 PM|Norway||Bergen|Pilsener
16840|Aass Uten |Aass Bryggeri|6|3|5|4|10|2.8|Medium head of white, coarse lace; clear, yellow body. Aroma of nice floral hops with some notes of straw and metal. This, mostly clean taste, with lots of hops and some caramel, straw, and water. Nicely dry finish. Excellent for a non-alcoholic beer. For a pilsener it's decent, but with too little malts.|11/8/2005 1:11:32 PM|Norway||Drammen|Low Alcohol
28591|Munkholm Alkoholfritt Juleøl|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|2|4|2|2|2|1.2|  Big light beige creamy head with coarse lace in the middle. Body is deep red. Sickly sweet unbalanced aroma of malts, cinnamon, chocolate, and wet cardboard with buttery notes. Taste is buttery straw with roasty caramel notes and a bitter cardboard aftertaste. (0.33l bottle. Also rated it much more positively late Nov 2005. Did rating over again now, without looking at previous rating.)|11/8/2005 1:04:37 PM|Norway||Oslo|Low Alcohol
18177|Lysholmer Double Ice Light|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|5|3|4|2|5|1.9|Medium, white coarse-laced head atop yellow copper body. Powerful hop aroma with some straw notes; not too nice. Taste is thin grain soup  with light hop notes in the finish. No bitterness. Why make this? If I wanted to stay sober I&#8217;d rather drink water.|11/5/2005 5:25:14 PM|Norway||Oslo|Low Alcohol
52943|Hansa Ekstra Vellagret Julebrygg 4.7%|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|6|5|5|3|11|3|Deep dark red-brown body under creamy tan head. Deep, dense, sweet aroma with notes of coffee, and perhaps a little butter? Taste is rather like the aroma, but sweeter, and with more of the butter. Hardly any aftertaste. Strange that they should bother storing the beer only to end up with this. Points for effort, but minus for the result. (Need to retaste this one; if gr0ve likes it this much, maybe the glass was polluted by the previous beer (Tuborg juleøl)).|11/5/2005 5:23:03 PM|Norway||Bergen|Dunkel
52851|Tuborg Juleøl 4.5%|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|4|3|4|2|7|2|White, smallish coarse-laced head; clear copper body. Doesn't look like a Christmas beer to me. Strange, nutty aroma that seems slightly off. Taste is no better, really. Quite hoppy, but nothing much else is detectable, except some ugly buttery notes. Aftertaste is also poor. Not sure why I bother describing it this carefully. Surely this particular bottle must be off? It can't really be this bad, can it? Hard to see how this stuff would do anyone any good, Tuborg included.|11/5/2005 5:19:15 PM|Norway||Oslo|Vienna
28220|Borg Juleøl 4.7%|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|7|4|6|4|13|3.4|Small, tan, normal-laced head; clear, dark red watery-looking body. Strong, sweet aroma with quite a bit of coffee. Taste is quite firm and sweet, but a little watery; aftertaste has some hops and some faint coffee notes. Too watery, but otherwise quite good. If they firmed it up this would be very good.|11/5/2005 1:22:37 PM|Norway||Bergen|Vienna
18292|Ringnes Julebrygg|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|6|3|6|3|12|3|Smallish, offwhite head, clear dark red body. Sweet cinnamon malt aroma with some peppery hints to it and some hop notes. Taste is cleanly malty and lightly burnt, slightly watery, with a soft, faintly dry aftertaste. Another light, clean Christmas beer without much taste.|11/5/2005 12:50:53 PM|Norway||Oslo|Vienna
11255|Dahls Juleøl 4.5%|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|7|4|6|4|11|3.2|Biggish, tan, creamy head, subsiding quickly; clear red-brown body. Compact aroma with prominent roastiness and hints of spice, almost vinous. Deep, firm taste of malts with some roast, and a clear, dry aftertaste. Among the better Christmas beers this year.|11/5/2005 12:39:24 PM|Norway||Oslo|Vienna
18297|Ringnes Juleøl 4.5%|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|6|3|6|4|11|3|Medium white creamy head; clear chestnut brown body. Aroma of sweet malts and some hops, with hints of roastiness. Taste is clean, light and sweet, faintly watery, with some maltiness and faint roastiness. Aftertaste is pretty faint. A well-made beer, having nothing wrong with it, but definitely intended to please the Norwegian market by tasting as little as a Christmas beer could possibly get away with.|11/5/2005 12:37:00 PM|Norway||Oslo|Vienna
19079|Frydenlund Juleøl Fra Fat|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|6|4|6|3|12|3.1|Coarse-laced tan medium head; clear, dark red body. Sweet, malty aroma, not too strong, with hints of licorice. Soft, malty taste with a strange tangy edge to it. Aftertaste is faintly bitter and quite rounded, with some roastiness. An OK Christmas beer, but not really that interesting.|11/4/2005 3:14:19 PM|Norway||Oslo|Vienna
52941|Aass Very Christmas|Aass Bryggeri|5|3|6|4|12|3|Tan, smallish head, creamy head with large bubbles, subsides quickly. Clear, dark winy red body. Aroma is entirely cinnamon and cloves, and some water. Not really that pleasant. Taste is like the aroma, but with rather more roastiness. No real aftertaste, unfortunately. Well. The idea of a spiced beer is good, but the beer itself is only OK.|11/4/2005 2:25:38 PM|Norway||Drammen|Vienna
1030|Aass Juleøl 4.5%|Aass Bryggeri|8|4|7|4|15|3.8|Medium, creamy, tan head with a spattering of larger bubbles; clear, dark winy red body. Sweet aroma of syrup, cinnamon, and some roast malts. Aroma is quite thick and satisfying. Roasty taste, with a dry finish, which lingers in the mouth, together with the roastiness.  On further acquaintance, a bit watery. A good Christmas beer; could use a bit more sharpness, but a good effort. Certainly better than expected. (0.33l bottle.)|11/4/2005 2:09:54 PM|Norway||Drammen|Vienna
12422|Frydenlund Bokkøl|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|7|4|6|4|12|3.3|Medium creamy off-white head; clear dark wine-red body. Sweet aroma of chocolate and bread. Sweet, treacly taste, somewhat watery, yet very clear. Ends in a faintly aftertaste with very faint hop hints. Not at all bad, but a little weak and boring.|11/4/2005 2:01:15 PM|Norway||Oslo|Dunkler Bock
709|Carlsberg Lager |Carlsberg Brewery|5|3|5|3|10|2.6|Medium white head. Yellow body with carbonation. Grassy musty rubbery aroma . Dry-sweetish salty grassy papery taste with mineraly floral notes. Mid-bodied. Dusty mouthfeel. Dry minty metallic aftertaste with floral papery notes. It's OK, but bland, and generally mixes good elements with bad. &#40;0.33l bottle, Systembolaget, Charlottenberg.&#41;|11/4/2005 1:56:06 PM|Denmark||Copenhagen|Pale Lager
345|Lindemans Pêche Lambic (Pêcheresse)|Brouwerij Lindemans|7|4|7|4|15|3.7|Thin, white head over hazy honey-coloured body. Deep aroma of peach with sharper, more acidic notes. Lovely taste combining peach and gueuze-like flavours with a dry, slightly stale finish. Very good.|11/1/2005 2:35:59 PM|Belgium||St Pieters Leeuw-Vlezenbeek|Lambic - Fruit
4637|Gouden Carolus Classic|Brouwerij Het Anker|8|4|8|5|18|4.3|Big, offwhite, creamy head with large bubbles; body clear dark red. Deep aroma of caramel, bread, and spice.  Taste is broad and sweet, with some alcohol heat, settling into an aftertaste with faint roastiness and lots of spice. Licorice. Nice balancing aftertaste, which lingers. Excellent! One of the best beers made.|11/1/2005 2:34:15 PM|Belgium||Mechelen|Belgian Strong Ale
6957|Moeder Overste|Brasserie Lefebvre|7|4|7|5|16|3.9|Huge, coarse, off-white head; dull, brown hazy body. Sweet, cinnamon, bready aroma, with thin estery notes to it. Lovely, sweet, rounded taste of caramel, honey and yeast, which ends in a nice bitter finish that somehow merges with the sweetness. An excellent, and very unusual, tripel.|11/1/2005 2:30:47 PM|Belgium||Rebecq-Quenast|Abbey Tripel
7947|Mack Pilsner|Mack Bryggeri|5|3|6|4|13|3.1|Medium, white normally laced head.; clear pale golden body. Faint hop aroma. Taste is clean and light, with a nice crisp edge to the aftertaste, and a definite saaz aroma. Very nice. Worthy, in fact, of a German brewery. (Not so strange, perhaps, given that Ludwig Mack *was* German.)|11/1/2005 2:28:01 PM|Norway||Tromsø|Pilsener
13979|Mack Haakon|Mack Bryggeri|6|4|6|3|12|3.1|Big, offwhite coarse-laced head; clear light brown body. Caramel malt aroma with hop hints. Taste is surprisingly fruity, mostly dominated by a very nice hop profile, and caramel malt tones. Aftertaste is nicely rounded and bitter, if somewhat subdued. Much better than expected. Somewhat light, but still a very good dark lager. It&#8217;s the aroma hops that really make this beer.|11/1/2005 2:25:51 PM|Norway||Tromsø|Premium Lager
717|Pilsner Urquell |Plzensky Prazdroj (SABMiller)|5|3|6|4|13|3.1|Pale golden body under rapidly subsiding head of coarse white lace. Faint aroma of malt and crisp hops. Clean malty taste with hints of straw; clean crisp bitter hop finish. A very well-made pilsner, though not that exciting. Certainly not the best pilsner I&#8217;ve had.|11/1/2005 2:23:41 PM|Czech Republic||Plzen|Bohemian Pilsener
4781|Liefmans Frambozenbier|Liefmans (Moortgat)|7|3|6|4|13|3.3|Tan-pink creamy head with large bubbles in; body is opaque drab red. Aroma is sharp raspberry with hints of sourness. Taste is subtle raspberry with unidentifiable notes and a sharp edge. Aftertaste is quite dry. Sourish. Well, not bad, but not that exciting, either. (0.33l bottle. 2002 vintage sampled in 2005.)|11/1/2005 2:21:13 PM|Belgium||Oudenaarde|Sour Ale/Wild Ale
1267|Guinness Draught|St. James's Gate (Diageo)|5|5|5|4|11|3|Milky brown body settles into medium beige creamy head, sharply separated from the nearly opaque but in fact deep dark red translucent body. Milky vaguely caramelly and chocolatey aroma with faint metallic notes. Dry-sweetish roasty metallic caramel taste. Mid-bodied. Mild, soft mouthfeel. Dry milky metallic aftertaste with vague burnt notes. Fairly bland, but easy to drink, and no real off tastes other than the metal. &#40;0.5l can, Rema, Lillestrøm. Second rating. Initial rating from 2005 was much too positive.&#41;|11/1/2005 2:16:59 PM|Ireland||Dublin|Dry Stout

Very faint aroma of sweet caramelly malts. Taste is clean and light, quite sweet, notes of licorice and treacle. It gives way to a faintly bitter aftertaste, with a vague hop taste. Very mild, and not really very interesting. (From can.)|11/1/2005 2:13:56 PM|Ireland||Kilkenny, County Kilkenny|Irish Ale
13521|Arendals Pils|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|5|3|5|3|9|2.5|Medium white coarse-laced head; clear, pale yellow body. Faint, watery aroma with some caramel and hops. Taste is light and sweetish with a bit of caramel and a vague, slightly unpleasant hop finish. At best boring, at worst a little off-putting. Starts off ok, goes all bland and boring, then takes a definite dive in the finish. Lacks any form of &quot;bite&quot;.|11/1/2005 2:10:59 PM|Norway||Oslo|Premium Lager
4791|Staropramen &#268;erný (Dark/Temné)|Staropramen Breweries (StarBev)|6|4|6|4|13|3.3|Small, tan head with coarse lace over clear dark brown body. Aroma is light and sweet; not very strong. Taste is clean, light, not too powerful. Malty, with quite a bit of roastiness; roastiness grows more pronounced in aftertaste, which also has nice, rounded bitterness. A well-made beer, but not very exciting.|11/1/2005 2:06:24 PM|Czech Republic||Prague|Dunkel
51144|Asahi 920|Asahi Breweries|3|4|4|4|9|2.4|Small, normal-laced head over clear copper body. Aroma is nearly non-existent. Taste is likewise extremely light, before some slight bitterness and hop aroma emerges in the aftertaste. Well, this has to win the prize for least-tasting beer ever.|11/1/2005 2:00:55 PM|Japan||Tokyo|Premium Lager
51147|Asahi 787|Asahi Breweries|4|3|6|4|11|2.8|Clear, pale yellow body under a small, white, normal-laced head. Aroma is very faint and hard to place. Mostly stale apple, I'd say. Taste has more body to it than the other two in this series I've tried, but the same cleanness. Taste is mostly very light malts, followed by a nice, crisp bitterness. Not much to this, but nothing wrong with it, either. Best thing about it is probably the aftertaste.|10/25/2005 4:45:01 PM|Japan||Tokyo|Premium Lager
13724|Munkholm|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|4|2|2|2|4|1.4|Medium coarse-laced white head, which quickly subsides completely. Clear copper body. Powerful aroma of straw and some caramel. Taste is a mix of straw and watery grain soup. Aftertaste has some bitterness, but hardly any aroma, as if they've only put in used hops. This is just piss poor. Probably the worst beer I've ever tasted (provided we except ones that had gone bad).|10/16/2005 3:54:04 PM|Norway||Oslo|Low Alcohol
46301|Ringnes Lettøl|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|5|3|4|3|6|2.1|Biggish white creamy head specked with larger bubbles topping clear copper body. Faint aroma of caramel-like malts and grain with a hint of hops. Taste is all grain, cereal and some straw, with very slight roastiness. Watery mouthfeel. Aftertaste has hints of hops and bitterness, but is mostly watered-out grain. This is pretty poor, if not really unpleasant. Why not dump in some hops to give it some taste and hide the worst? Too expensive, probably.|10/16/2005 3:49:54 PM|Norway||Oslo|Low Alcohol
51145|Asahi 111|Asahi Breweries|5|3|6|4|11|2.9|Medium white normal-laced head over clear yellow body. Faintly floral aroma with hints of something I can't quite place, maybe a bit sourish. Taste is clean, light, and slightly malty, but quickly overpowered by a nice floral hop aftertaste with only slight bitterness. Very light aftertaste. Much lighter than in the 318. Of the two I've tasted so far, this is clearly the least interesting.|10/16/2005 10:41:42 AM|Japan||Tokyo|Premium Lager
51146|Asahi 318|Asahi Breweries|5|4|6|4|12|3.1|Huge, white coarse head over a clear light yellow body. Aroma is light, clean, faintly sweet, and faintly hoppy. Little malts in the aroma, it's more floral. Taste is very light initially with faint maltiness and hints of sweetness, then quite hoppy and bitter in the aftertaste. Very well balanced, and extremely clean, but not much character. Lovely hop profile in aftertaste.|10/16/2005 5:21:44 AM|Japan||Tokyo|Premium Lager
43910|Freiberger Freibergisch Bock Dunkel|Freiberger Brauhaus (Actris Group)|5|3|7|3|14|3.2|Small, tan, normal-laced head, reddish brown body. Very faint aroma of sweet malts. Unusual taste of light roastiness, with aftertaste somewhat like smoked toffee. Very sweet, with a taste that lingers. Smooth at first, then roasty. Very strange; never had anything quite like it. Relatively light mouthfeel; taste not too strong. Good, and very interesting.|10/15/2005 4:24:54 PM|Germany|Saxony|Freiberg|Dunkler Bock
32690|Grans Bare Øl|Grans Bryggeri|6|3|5|3|10|2.7|Small, fine-laced head, clear yellow body, neither light nor dark. Clean malt aroma with hints of hops. Taste is rather like the aroma, but more grainy, somewhat stale, and with metal hints in the rather dry aftertaste. Palate is clean, but very watery. Overall a very light beer, without much taste, but not entirely without faults. A half-decent pilsener.|10/15/2005 4:17:01 PM|Norway||Sandefjord|Pilsener
399|Hoegaarden |Brouwerij Hoegaarden (InBev)|6|4|6|3|15|3.4|Creamy, white head with a spattering of large darkish bubbles, over opaque dirty yellow body. Aroma is pretty faint, but citrusy and spicy. Taste is light, mouthfeel marked by carbonation hiding most of what is initially going on, leaving a light citrusy taste with notes of something else (probably coriander). Overall, a light, clean, refreshing beer, but ot the greatest of beer experiences, perhaps. It feels strange to criticize such an established world classic, but the fact is that there are better witbiers around (the other Hoegaardens being the prime examples of this).|10/12/2005 2:55:46 PM|Belgium||Hoegaarden|Belgian White (Witbier)
10092|Ur-Krostitzer Schwarzes|Krostitzer Brauerei (Oetker Group)|6|4|6|3|13|3.2|Dark, clear, red-brown body under a medium tan normal-laced head. Light dry roasty aroma. Taste is rather like the aroma, but has a metallic tinge. Dry, metallic aftertaste. Not much taste to this one, and a bit thin. Typical German schwarzes, really. (0.5l bottle.)|10/12/2005 2:51:51 PM|Germany|Saxony|Krostitz|Schwarzbier
3990|Diebels Alt|Brauerei Diebels (InBev)|7|4|7|4|15|3.7|Medium creamy whitish head, which subsides quickly, over dark red-brown clear body. Aroma of caramel and perhaps some bread.  Strong taste of caramel with notes of burntness; the taste fades towards the end, leaving a taste somewhat like burnt breakfast cereal with some bitterness. Very clean and smooth. A highly drinkable beer, but one with some character. (0.5l bottle.)|10/8/2005 3:39:32 PM|Germany|North Rhine-Westphalia|Issum|Altbier
25639|Original Ritterguts Gose|Ritterguts Gose GmbH|6|3|7|3|14|3.3|Medium creamy white head with some big bubbles, which subsides quickly.  Milky orange body.  Aroma is sourish with notes of flour and maybe a hint of coriander.  Taste is big, with a citrus-like sourness which balances in the mouth. Aftertaste is thin, lingering sourness. A very unusual beer, and a lot more drinkable than the description of the beer type would have you think. I quite like it, without really thinking it the greatest invention of the beer world.|10/8/2005 2:35:43 PM|Germany|Saxony|Borna|Traditional Ale
13975|Frydenlund Fatøl|Ringnes Bryggeri (Carlsberg)|6|4|4|3|10|2.7|Biggish white medium-laced head, light copper, clear body. Light, grainy aroma, with some metal notes and pilsener hops. Palate none too smooth; mostly grainy taste with some off notes. Well. It's a pilsener. It's drinkable. It doesn't really stand out in any way, though. (0.5l can.)|10/8/2005 1:57:52 PM|Norway||Oslo|Pale Lager
10166|Ur-Krostitzer Feinherbes Pilsner|Krostitzer Brauerei (Oetker Group)|2|4|6|4|13|2.9|Medium white creamy head sites nicely atop clear straw yellow body, with constant carbonation. Faint aroma of hops and maybe some straw. Clean, soft, and smooth mouthfeel. When cold it's terribly boring; when warmer there's still hardly any malt taste, but quite a powerful hop taste, and quite bitter. Quite a good pilsener. Very nice edge to the bitterness, which balances nicely on the tongue. A subtle beer; quite good.|10/8/2005 1:26:27 PM|Germany|Saxony|Krostitz|Classic German Pilsener
1417|Warsteiner Premium Verum|Warsteiner Brauerei|5|4|5|4|11|2.9|Biggish white coarse head, clear, pale yellow body. Aroma is relatively faint (on an airplane, at least), mostly pilsner hops. Very clean and smooth mouthfeel with little taste; aftertaste is a lovely rounded bitterness, with strong hop notes. Very bitter for a pilsener. For a pilsener this is not bad at all, but perhaps a bit too much metal in the aftertaste. (0.33l bottle.)|10/8/2005 1:22:35 PM|Germany|North Rhine-Westphalia|Warstein|Classic German Pilsener
49276|Haandbryggeriet Dunkel Weizen|Haandbryggeriet (Norway)|6|4|7|4|16|3.7|Big, tan, coarse-laced head which quickly subsides. Body is dark brown-red, nearly opaque. Carbonation keeps going on. If you pour in the yeast sediment you can enjoy watching yeast balls sinking, then getting caught by bubble streamers and being carried up, then being dropped at the top and starting over. (Or not, if you find yeast unappetizing. :) Aroma is yeasty, sweet, peppery, with lots of roastiness. Taste is huge, roasty, and sweet, with an aftertaste of coffee. Very good! This is a great dunkelweizen, though the weizenness of it is not exactly obvious. It's more like a cross with a stout, really. (0.5l bottle.)|10/2/2005 1:42:53 PM|Norway||Drammen|Dunkelweizen
49275|Haandbryggeriet Bavarian Weizen|Haandbryggeriet (Norway)|6|5|7|4|15|3.7|A big head of coarse lace atop dark yellow hazy body with bubble streamers. Sweet aroma of wheat malts and banana. Big, round taste of strong banana or chewing gum, with faintly bitter/dry finish. Some faint, refreshing sourness. Very nice and refreshing, with enough taste to make it interesting. Not the top weizen, but good.|10/2/2005 1:34:26 PM|Norway||Drammen|German Hefeweizen
5092|Poperings Hommelbier|Van Eecke|7|4|6|3|13|3.3|Clear yellow body with some yeast particles under a big, creamy head. Strange, subdued hoppy aroma; not sure what kind of hops they used, but have smelt it before. Very nice. The taste is dominated by the same soft, almost salty or stale, hops. Very subtle, and very nice. Never tried anything like this before.|10/2/2005 5:45:39 AM|Belgium||Poperinge-Watou|Belgian Ale
28635|Skands New Stout|Bryggeriet Skands|5|4|5|3|11|2.8|Small, offwhite head, normal lace. Dark wine-red clear body. Earthy aroma of coffee, banana, and compost. Taste is much the same, but roastier, with hints of smoke. Mouthfeel is a little watery. Some caramel. Not really very stout-like, more like a lager my notes say &#40;from both ratings&#41;. Not really very good. Flawed. &#40;0.5l bottle, Oslo-Copenhagen ferry.&#41;|10/2/2005 5:43:04 AM|Denmark||Brøndby|Stout
37858|Skands Nicks Ale|Bryggeriet Skands|6|3|6|3|11|2.9|Medium coarse-laced white head; clear whiskey-coloured body. Quite big aroma of plums, malts, alcohol and notes of something like cognac.  Taste is light malts, giving way to hops in the finish. Unpleasant metal notes throughout. Not much here. It&#8217;s a beer. Some interest in the taste, but not much. Ah well.|10/2/2005 5:39:30 AM|Denmark||Brøndby|English Pale Ale
10585|Ettaler Curator Doppelbock|Klosterbrauerei Ettal|6|5|6|4|15|3.6|Small, offwhite head over dark red-brown clear body. Sweet smell of toffeelike malts. Big, sweet taste of malty, caramelly sweetness, slowly growing bitter towards the end. Good, but doesn't really stand out.|9/30/2005 6:16:57 PM|Germany|Bavaria|Ettal|Doppelbock
342|Lindemans Framboise|Brouwerij Lindemans|8|4|7|4|16|3.9|Thin pink coarse-laced head; ruby-red opaque body. Powerful aroma of, well, raspberry; sourish, kind of like a raspberry sauce. Taste is all raspberry, big and round, somewhat stale, growing sharpish towards the end. May sound boring (or like I'm very unimaginative :), but it's actually very nice. Not in the least artificial-tasting, and not so sour you can't enjoy it.|9/30/2005 6:15:38 PM|Belgium||St Pieters Leeuw-Vlezenbeek|Lambic - Fruit
9805|Grottenbier Bruin|St. Bernardus Brouwerij|7|5|7|5|16|4|Big white cream head topping wine-red hazy body. Aroma is jelly of wild berries. Big taste that's one great lump of stale hops, old wood, and something musty; aftertaste is mostly bitterness and stale hops. Strangely soft and watery mouthfeel. Really dominated by the hops, but it takes a while to taste it. Good, but not the revelation I'd been led to expect.|9/30/2005 6:12:49 PM|Belgium||Watou|Abbey Dubbel
3960|Augustijn Grand Cru|Brouwerij Van Steenberge|7|4|6|4|14|3.5|Huge, creamy, white head which dwarfs the small orange-yellowish hazy body. (Half of an 0.33l bottle.) Big, fruity aroma of banana and apples with typical Belgian yeast notes. Taste is surprisingly harmonic and subdued compared to the aroma, but is essentially more of the same. Let it stand a little over the best before date, which probably explains the aftertaste being somewhat off. Don't think this is a definitive tasting of this one. It's a good beer, but a little boring, as though something's missing. Not at all what I expected.|9/30/2005 6:10:23 PM|Belgium||Ertvelde|Belgian Strong Ale
4924|Rochefortoise Brune|Caulier|7|5|6|3|15|3.6|Huge, tan, creamy head, almost as big as the opaque black-brown body from half an 0.33l bottle. Aroma has huge caramelly sweetness  with hints of sourness and spice. Initially sweet, round, earthy, almost stale taste gives way to coffee-like roastiness with hints of bitterness, which turns into lingering bitterness and coffee. Mouthfeel is slightly watery. Reminiscent of a moccha coffee. Good, lots of taste, but maybe a little &quot;loose&quot;. Could do with more &quot;punch&quot;. Also a little too sweet.|9/29/2005 4:32:23 PM|Belgium||Péruwelz|Abbey Dubbel
49272|Haandbryggeriet India Pale Ale|Haandbryggeriet (Norway)|7|4|8|4|16|3.9|Hardly any head; what's there appears to be finely laced. Aroma is quite faint when cold, but has a mix of malts and citrusy hops. Taste is quite big, yet very clean and smooth (extremely harmonic). Again malts and citrusy hops with some metal notes. Metal notes grow stronger when warm. Finish is bitter, but not very. Very nice! A light, highly drinkable, and still interesting IPA. A nice complement to the stronger ones from Nøgne Ø.  (This is also the only IPA approved by my girlfriend, which says something about the drinkability.)|9/29/2005 3:45:41 PM|Norway||Drammen|India Pale Ale (IPA)
4935|Westvleteren Extra 8|Westvleteren Abdij St. Sixtus|6|5|7|4|16|3.8|Smallish white coarse-bubbled head atop an opaque black body which is dark brown towards the edges. Aroma is quite faint, some hints of bread and yeast. Taste is dense and hard to make out when cold. Leaving beer to warm up from fridge temperature for some minutes. When warmer: bready, spicy aroma. Still quite faint. Taste is more powerful, very harmonic, but it's hard to make out what it consists of. Not really that interesting. Strong aftertaste of spice, but can't tell which one. Perhaps paradise seeds? Quite bitter, but in a way that doesn't really add to the beer. Not sure what all the fuss over the Westvleteren beers are all about. Rochefort is clearly a lot better.|9/26/2005 12:47:55 PM|Belgium||Westvleteren|Belgian Strong Ale
6875|De Dolle Dulle Teve 10º (Mad Bitch)|De Dolle Brouwers|8|5|9|5|18|4.5|Huge, creamy white head, which takes forever to subside makes a nice contrast with the dark-orange opaque body. An aroma of yeasty bread hangs around it before I even lift it up to smell properly. Up close it smells more of spicy fruit with the signature de Dolle yeast aroma profile. Powerful, broad taste of bread, coriander, yeast with quite a bit of alcohol heat and a good deal of bitterness at the end. The bitterness is mostly overpowered by the taste, however. Very harmonic, yet complex. An extraordinary beer! Very, very good. Has to be one of the best trippels I've had, mad or sane. (0.33l bottle.)|9/26/2005 12:04:31 PM|Belgium||Diksmuide|Abbey Tripel
1269|Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Märzen|Brauerei Heller|8|5|7|4|16|4|Medium finely laced head topping a dark wine-red clear body. Aroma is mostly smoke, like smoked sausage minus the sausage. Some malts as well. Taste is sweet malts quickly overpowered by the smokiness, the fading into a smoky smooth bitterness. Aroma is smokier than the taste.  Somehow the smoke makes it feel silkily smooth. Taste settles in the mouth as you drink. A very interesting beer; so interesting, in fact, that drinking it in greater quantities requires some practice. It is more than worth the effort, though. &#40;0.5l bottle. Rerated.&#41;|9/26/2005 12:00:30 PM|Germany|Bavaria|Bamberg|Smoked
5005|Broughton Border Gold (Bottle)|Broughton|8|3|6|3|14|3.4|Largish, coarsely laced head over golden body. Sweet, dense aroma of apples and some hops. Powerful taste of apples, some smokiness, malty sweetness, and a bitter hop finish, with some metal notes. Overall a good ale, but nothing remarkable, and the metal detracts from it a bit. (0.5l bottle.)|9/26/2005 11:30:57 AM|Scotland||Biggar|Golden Ale/Blond Ale
27931|Würzburger Hofbräu Sympator Doppelbock|Würzburger Hofbräu (Schörghuber)|7|4|7|4|17|3.9|Smallish, white head over mahogany-red body. Sweet, malty, earthy, bread-like aroma. Smells somewhat stale, like most German beer. Powerful, sweet taste of malts, very nicely rounded, like marzipan, lingers for a long time in the mouth. An excellent doppelbock.|9/17/2005 5:07:45 PM|Germany|Bavaria|Würzburg|Doppelbock
5400|Rochefort Trappistes 8|Brasserie Rochefort|8|5|9|5|18|4.5|Big, tan, creamy head, red-black opaque body, with some yeast sediment at the bottom. Subtle aroma of nameless spices, perhaps some anis, perhaps coriander. Very harmonic aroma, and surprisingly subdued. Powerful, dark, spicy taste of malts, coffee, and again spices; very complex, almost burns in the mouth, but still with some harmony. Very dry. Well, what I can say? Beer does not get much better than this. This has to be in the top ten.|9/17/2005 4:52:25 PM|Belgium||Rochefort|Belgian Strong Ale
4663|Liefmans Goudenband|Liefmans (Moortgat)|7|4|8|5|17|4.1|Almost no head; deep red-brown colour. Deep cognac-like aroma. Powerful, sourish, sharp taste of dark wood, red wine, and cherry. Very, very good. An excellent Flemish sour ale!|9/17/2005 4:48:39 PM|Belgium||Oudenaarde|Sour Ale/Wild Ale
832|Abbaye des Rocs Brune|Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs|8|4|8|5|18|4.3|Medium creamy tan head over dark red-brown opaque body, with what appears to be yeast sediment at the bottom. Powerful aroma of sweet cinnamon and cloves with some fruitiness and sharpness. Lovely! Taste is powerful and quite sharp, consisting mostly of malts and the aroma, which grows more pronounced in the aftertaste. Excellent! A great brune!  (0.33l bottle in Orval glass.)|9/17/2005 2:44:47 PM|Belgium||Montignies-sur-Roc|Belgian Strong Ale
2445|Erdinger Pikantus|Erdinger Weissbräu|6|4|7|4|16|3.7|Fine offwhite head over black-orange opaque body. Aroma is faint, but sweetly spicy and malty. Big, sweet toffee-like taste, yet smooth, with some spiciness and complexity. Lingers and settles in the mouth as it fades. Taste grows stronger as you drink more.  (0.5l bottle, served Norwegian fashion, which means too cold and without all the yeast.)|9/17/2005 12:55:22 PM|Germany|Bavaria|Erding|Weizen Bock
2019|Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel|Brauerei Aying|7|5|7|4|17|4|Big tan, creamy head over beautifully dark red/purple body. Aroma of very sweet malts, with notes of syrup and hay. Nice. The taste is again very sweet and malty, but is soon dominated by a smoky hay-like flavour, which lingers and fades. Subtle, yet complex, and very interesting. An excellent lager!  (0.5l bottle in glass.)|9/16/2005 4:11:50 PM|Germany|Bavaria|Aying|Dunkel
15823|La Barberie Blanche aux Agrumes|La Barberie|7|3|5|3|8|2.6|Smallish white head, looking somewhat coarse because of the large bubbles. Body is a kind of muddy yellow. Aroma is interesting; kind of thin, and fruity, with strange notes of soap, tea, and something darker. Very powerful taste, with strong notes of what seems like grapefruit; very sour. There are promising things in the taste, but the grapefruit overwhelms it and makes it hard to come to terms with. Didn&#8217;t really enjoy this, but the aroma is nice. A beer to smell, but not to drink, I guess is the conclusion.  (0.5l bottle in glass.)  Looking up &quot;agrumes&quot; in a French dictionary I see that it means &quot;citrus fruit&quot;. Yeah. That figures.|9/16/2005 3:38:34 PM|Canada|Quebec|Québec City|Belgian White (Witbier)
1|Beamish Irish Stout|Heineken Ireland|6|5|6|4|15|3.6|Big, tan, creamy head over black opaque body. Lots of creamy carbonation in the body that slowly settles into the head, sharply dividing the beer into black body and tan head. Aroma is relatively faint, consisting mostly of roasty maltiness and some metal with some hints of toffee-like sweetness. Taste is deep, roasty treacle leading into a sharply dry finish, which is very bitter, with notes of steel. A good stout, if somewhat light and watery. Overall, it's perhaps a bit brutal without really offering enough in return for the brutality.  (0.5l can in glass.)|9/14/2005 3:51:03 PM|Ireland||Cork|Dry Stout
4056|Belhaven St Andrews Ale (Bottle)|Belhaven (Greene King)|6|4|7|4|15|3.6|Medium white head, dark red-brown body. Aroma is tart and sourish, with hints of smoke. Taste is strongly smoky, almost like rauchbier, with a rounded body, and smoky aftertaste. An interesting beer, and quite good, but not something to drink a lot of.  (0.5l bottle in glass.)|9/14/2005 2:57:58 PM|Scotland||Dunbar, East Lothian|Premium Bitter/ESB
674|Ruddles County (Filtered)|Greene King|7|4|7|4|16|3.8|Medium tan head, which quickly subsides, over clear, nutty brown body. Aroma is malts with hints of something nutty and also hops. The taste is quite big and grows to a powerful finish, which is quite bitter. Taste appears to be mostly malts, but the nuttiness is even more pronounced here. A very good beer, and very drinkable.  (0.5l bottle in glass. Unfortunately, now with a modern cork instead of the delightful cap Ruddles used to have.)|9/14/2005 1:52:05 PM|England|Suffolk|Bury St. Edmunds|Premium Bitter/ESB
14733|Avery Salvation|Avery Brewing Company|8|3|6|4|14|3.5|Small white head, which quickly disappears, over orange-red body. Lovely, fruity aroma with notes of honey, yeast, and spice. Big, full taste, with grass and fruit notes; very like a normal Belgian trippel. Something odd about it, though, like a slightly off taste. Aftertaste is quite bitter, in fact, maybe too bitter. Overall, a good beer, but certainly far from the best trippel I've had.  (0.65l bottle in glass.)|9/12/2005 3:20:18 PM|United States|Colorado|Boulder|Belgian Strong Ale
14600|Würzburger Hofbräu Schwarzbier|Würzburger Hofbräu (Schörghuber)|7|4|8|5|16|4|Medium-sized creamy head, dark-red almost black clear body. Aroma is sweet and raisin-like. Deep, dry toffee/raisin taste, which in the aftertaste dries up. An excellent schwarzbier. Taste could have lingered longer, though. (0.5l bottle.)|9/11/2005 11:12:51 AM|Germany|Bavaria|Würzburg|Schwarzbier
5047|Julius Echter Hefe-Weissbier Hell|Würzburger Hofbräu (Schörghuber)|6|4|6|3|14|3.3|Biggish white lasting shiny head. Hazy pale yellow body. Light chalky herbal bananaish aroma. Dryish-sweet bananaish milky pepper taste, soft and rounded, with herbal notes. Full body, mild mouthfeel. Dryish oily banana aftertaste with spicy notes. Light hoppy notes linger. Nice weizen. &#40;0.33l draft at Thüringer Hof, Leipzig. Previously rated at Bäcköfele, Würzburg.&#41;|9/11/2005 11:10:22 AM|Germany|Bavaria|Würzburg|German Hefeweizen
4634|St. Georgen Bräu Keller Bier   |St. Georgen Bräu|3|5|7|5|17|3.7|Arrives in usual stone mug. Nice, creamy head, not too big. Aroma is mostly sweetness with some hops. Big hoppy, meaty, sweet taste. Like a really good IPA, giving way to bitterness and more hops. Very good, and very drinkable. An excellent kellerbier.  (0.5l stone mug.)|9/11/2005 11:04:33 AM|Germany|Bavaria|Buttenheim|Zwickel/Keller/Landbier
14191|Hufeisen Pottensteiner Bio-Dunkel|Gasthausbrauerei Hufeisen|7|3|7|4|16|3.7|Biggish, fine off-white head, dark brown-yellow cloudy body. (Not sure about the colour; it was dark, and the light at the brewery was yellow.) Sweet, toffee-like aroma. Big sweet toffee/licorice taste, with slightly hoppy aftertaste. Complex taste. Aftertaste lingers. A very interesting beer, somewhat heavy by German standards. (0.5l mug on tap at the brewery pub.)|9/11/2005 11:01:29 AM|Germany|Bavaria|Pottenstein|Dunkel
14869|Hufeisen Kellerweizen Naturtrüb|Gasthausbrauerei Hufeisen|7|4|6|3|15|3.5|Biggish cream-like white head, which subsides. Cloudy, straw-yellow body. Aroma is weizen-like with banana notes, and something else. Makes me think of ice cream. Round, not too strong, slightly sweet weizen taste, light and pleasant, followed by bitterness, which is sharper than usual for a weizen. Not sure what is so special about this, except possibly the extra bitterness. Overall, a nice, light summer drink, not that special.  (0.33l on tap at the brewery pub.)|9/11/2005 10:56:17 AM|Germany|Bavaria|Pottenstein|German Hefeweizen
25044|Pottensteiner Höhlentrunk|St. Georgen Bräu|7|3|8|4|16|3.8|Medium finely laced head which barely subsides. Orangle body with continuous carbonation. Lovely hoppy aroma. Broad, deep taste, dominated by aroma-hops, almost like an American IPA. A very good beer, interesting and highly drinkable.   (0.5l mug on tap at the Bruckmayer brewery inn, which claimed they made it. This was 2005-09-01, so maybe things have changed since 2003. Not sure.)  Probably named after the famous Teufelshöhle (devil's cave) just outside Pottenstein.|9/11/2005 10:53:45 AM|Germany|Bavaria|Buttenheim|Zwickel/Keller/Landbier
50959|Kathi-Bräu Dunkles Lagerbier|Kathi-Bräu|6|4|7|4|15|3.6|Medium offwhite head of large bubbles, clear dark red body. Smoky, meaty aroma, not too strong. Taste is deep, but not really strong. I'd be hard-pressed to describe it, but the aftertaste is quite bitter. Overall quite hoppy. A very good example of the Franconian dark lager.  (0.5l mug on tap at the brewery outdoor serving.)|9/11/2005 10:49:19 AM|Germany|Bavaria|Aufseß-Heckenhof|Dunkel
34782|Stadter Landbier|Brauerei Stadter|6|4|6|4|14|3.4|Largish offwhite head, red-brown body. Smoky, hoppy aroma, not too strong. Broad, deep taste with meaty, smoky notes, which culminates nicely, then fades into a nice bitter finish. A good beer, but not too interesting. The smokiness lingers, and grows as you drink.

15618|Leikeim Premium|Familien-Brauhaus Leikeim|7|4|3|1|15|3|Huge head of all equal-sized bubbles, subsides after a while, leaving a column in the middle. Pale yellow body, where carbonation keeps on for a long time. Fine, thin aroma, with strong hop notes. (Girlfriend claims it smells like white wine.) Taste is very light, with a lovely hop finish, which is dry, malty, and rounded. Once white wine has been mentioned it's hard not to taste white wine in it. Very good for a pilsener, mostly because of the hops. (0.5l bottle in Leikeim glasses.)|9/11/2005 10:38:36 AM|Germany|Bavaria|Altenkunstadt|Premium Lager
35981|Aufsesser Festbier|Brauereigasthof Rothenbach (Aufsesser Brauerei)|7|4|8|4|16|3.9|Big beige head of fine bubbles. Clear dark amber body. Strong, sweet malt aroma, with hints of licorice. Taste is initially dark malts, followed by a strong taste of treacle/licorice with a dry smoky finish. A very good beer, and quite interesting.

Taste is quite powerful and deep, consisting mostly of sweet maltiness and smoky earthiness, with a bitter, dry finish. Something smoky lingers between sips. Overall an unusual dunkel, interesting, and quite good.  (0.5l glass mug on tap at the brewery inn.)|9/11/2005 10:30:17 AM|Germany|Bavaria|Aufsess|Dunkel

Carbonation looks unusual, but I'm hard pressed to describe how. Aroma is faint, but promising; basically like a good weizen with a hint of smokiness. The taste is harmonic, but initially weak. Soon a smoky, fruity taste sets in, which subsides, leaving only the smoke. An unusual weizen, interesting, but not really that good.

The only beer made from spelt I've had, or heard of. 0.33l bottle.  Largish white head, cloudy dark yellow body. Arona is fine and fruity with honey notes. Very reminiscent of weizen with clean estery notes, vaguely watery, and faint crispness in the finish. Drinkable, somewhat watery. Could do with more assertiveness. Faintly sour, without really being refreshing. Doubt I&#8217;ll ever drink this again.|9/11/2005 10:23:15 AM|Germany|Bavaria|Neumarkt in der Oberpfalz|Specialty Grain
24572|Bayreuther Aktien Dunkel|Bayreuther Bierbrauerei|6|4|7|4|16|3.7|Smallish offwhite head which quickly subsides, dark, barely translucent mahogany body. Aroma is fainly sweet and soapy. (Uh? In a dunkel?) Taste is odd, mostly like licorice with notes of metal, malts, and earthiness. An interesting beer, and quite drinkable. Not sure what type this really is; seems to me more like a schwarzbier. (Was called Süffiges Dunkles on the menu, but from Bayreuther Aktien. Hope it's the same beer.)|9/7/2005 3:47:45 PM|Germany|Bavaria|Bayreuth|Dunkel
6089|Maisels Weisse Kristall|Brauerei Gebr. Maisel Bayreuth|6|3|6|4|14|3.3|Tall, white, fine head, pale yellow body; clear, of course. Aroma is faint, but recognizably weizen, with estery, banana-like tones. The taste is clean and light, with fruity tones, which fade out, leaving slight bitterness. Crisp and refreshing, and quite good, but not that interesting. Basically like a superior pilsener. (0.5l on tap.)|9/7/2005 3:45:16 PM|Germany|Bavaria|Bayreuth|German Kristallweizen
50835|Kulmbacher Museumsbier|Bayerisches Brauereimuseum Kulmbach|4|3|6|3|13|2.9|Small, thin head, pale yellow colour. Faint aroma, primarily of pilsener and some hops. Light, malty taste, which turns fruity and hoppy towards the end. A good, refreshing pilsener,  which is kind of like a piece of normally good bread: not that exciting. Interesting that they actually brew it in the museum, though.|9/7/2005 3:38:26 PM|Germany|Bavaria|Kulmbach|Oktoberfest/Märzen
24569|Bayreuther Aktien Zwick'l Kellerbier|Bayreuther Bierbrauerei|6|4|7|4|14|3.5|Medium offwhite head. Slightly hazy brown body with carbonation. Grainy dusty strawy aroma with earthy caramel notes. Dry-sweet grassy grainy dusty taste with strawy earthy notes. Mid-bodied. Mild, soft, clean mouthfeel. Dry grainy toffee and earth aftertaste with caramelly strawy butter notes. Lovely&#033; Extremely drinkable. &#40;0.5l swingtop bottle, Salling, Århus. Also rated in 2005, but that rating was crap, so replaced it.&#41;|9/7/2005 3:21:01 PM|Germany|Bavaria|Bayreuth|Zwickel/Keller/Landbier
14669|Schinner Altfranken Braunbier|Bürgerbräu Bayreuth|6|4|6|3|14|3.3|Huge, seemingly everlasting head. Mahogany brown body. Aroma faintly sourish (uh?) with hop notes. Taste is subtle, harmonic, and well-rounded, although not too strong. Aftertaste just fades with teasing bitterness notes that last surprisingly long. Reminiscent of many of the Franconian dark lagers I've had, but distinctive, and yet not so interesting. In the typically German way the taste grows stronger as you drink. (On tap at Schinner.)|9/7/2005 3:16:16 PM|Germany|Bavaria|Bayreuth|Dunkel
6090|Maisels Weisse Dunkel|Brauerei Gebr. Maisel Bayreuth|7|5|8|4|15|3.9|Fine off-white medium head, impressive black colour, turning black-orange towards the bottom. Aroma is deep and firm with whiffs of chocolate. (Wow! What's this?) Taste is deep, fruity, with overtones of chocolate, and slightly sour towards the end. An excellent dark weizen; probably my best so far.|9/7/2005 3:12:15 PM|Germany|Bavaria|Bayreuth|Dunkelweizen
4560|Maisels Weisse Original|Brauerei Gebr. Maisel Bayreuth|6|4|6|3|13|3.2|Big offwhite lasting head. Hazy opaque orangey body. Milky ash and carrot aroma with wheaty banana notes. Dry-sweetish milky banana and carrot taste with ashy notes. Mid-bodied. Rounded mouthfeel. Dry ashy milky soy sauce aftertaste. Nice, drinkable, unusual. I like it. &#40;0.5l bottle, from some supermarket in Kiel.&#41;|9/7/2005 3:06:06 PM|Germany|Bavaria|Bayreuth|German Hefeweizen
29030|Schnupp Altfränkisches|Brauerei-Gasthof Schnupp|6|3|7|4|15|3.5|Medium head, lightish brown colour. Cool, malty aroma, with faint fruitiness. Full, harmonic, well-rounded malt taste with faint hints of roastiness. Aftertaste is mostly hops and faint roastiness, somewhat dry. A good session beer, but not too interesting.|9/7/2005 3:02:56 PM|Germany|Bavaria|Neudrossenfeld-Altdrossenfeld|Dunkel
6222|EKU 28|Kulmbacher Brauerei (Schörghuber)|7|4|7|3|15|3.6|Largish finely laced head. Amber, whisky-like colour. Aroma is dense caramelly malts with notes of dried fruit and straw, with some alcohol. Powerful malty caramelly strawberry taste with alcohol and straw notes. Clean and harmonic, with considerable alcohol heat. Dry straw and caramel aftertaste. Smooth and quite balanced. Full-bodied. Very good for such a strong beer. &#40;0.33l bottle at Hagleite, Kulmbach, originally. Rerated from 0.1l taster from bottle at EBF '08.&#41;|9/7/2005 2:55:09 PM|Germany|Bavaria|Kulmbach|Eisbock
14367|Kulmbacher Eisbock|Kulmbacher Brauerei (Schörghuber)|8|4|8|4|17|4.1|Smallish off-white head, which subsides. Dark mahogany red body. Aroma is malty, with hints of alcohol and roastiness. Taste is dark and subtle, somewhat roasty, giving way to deep toffee-like sweetness and finally alcohol heat balanced by faint hop bitterness. A very good, and very interesting beer. I wouldn't have that many at once (for more than one reason :), but very good.|9/7/2005 10:33:30 AM|Germany|Bavaria|Kulmbach|Eisbock
1212|Orkney Red MacGregor (Bottle)|Orkney (Sinclair Breweries)|8|4|7|4|16|3.9|Smallish white fine-bubbled head over dark mahogany body. Lovely sweet, smoky flowery aroma with hop notes. Taste is very like the smell, but with slightly more pronounced smokiness. The finish is nicely rounded, but mostly a simple fading. A very good ale; strong, interesting taste, yet easily drinkable. (0.5l bottle, self-poured in lager glass.)|9/6/2005 1:12:54 PM|Scotland||Stromness|Premium Bitter/ESB
366|Sierra Nevada Porter|Sierra Nevada Brewing Company|7|4|7|4|15|3.7|Small, dark-beige head; very dark, nearly opaque red-black body. Deep, sweet licorice aroma with hints of hops. Taste is strong, roasty, and smooth, with a nice, bitter finish. A good porter, but not as  complex as I might wish. Very drinkable, though. (0.33l bottle self-poured in lager glass.)|9/6/2005 1:03:17 PM|United States|California|Chico|Porter
13667|Ommegang Three Philosophers|Brewery Ommegang (Moortgat)|8|4|8|4|16|4|Big beige head, very fine foam. Dark red colour. Sourish, mahogany aroma. Taste heavy, like a dark Belgian, but with hints of something sourish, mahogany-like. Very good, but more sippable than drinkable.|8/14/2005 3:45:54 PM|United States|New York|Cooperstown|Abt/Quadrupel
48264|Mack Ludwig Premium Brown Ale|Mack Bryggeri|6|3|6|3|13|3.1|500 ml can. Pours a dark reddish brown, medium head. Unremarkable appearance. Aroma is faint; vague hints of malts and spice. Taste is not very powerful, mostly malts and a hint of roastiness, somewhat sweet. The aftertaste is where it happens, the taste goes somewhat dry and more intense, but even that isn&#8217;t too heavy. My impression is that Mack is trying to introduce non-lager beer to their customers without scaring them off with something wild. If so, this might just work, or they might not be able to tell the difference between this and Norwegian bayer. Anyway, the beer is nice, drinkable, and unexciting.|8/9/2005 2:18:21 PM|Norway||Tromsø|Brown Ale
48236|Mack Ludwig Premium Hvete|Mack Bryggeri|6|3|6|3|12|3|500ml can. Pours a hazy light orange, with slight yeast, and small head. Can makes it difficult to get the yeast into the beer, so hefeweizen in a can is clearly not a great idea. Aroma is fainly fruity and banana-like. Taste is thin, somewhat sourish, with slight fruity and spicy notes. Pleasant, easy to drink, but not very remarkable. Probably a good way to introduce Norwegians unfamiliar with weizen to the style.|8/7/2005 4:27:52 PM|Norway||Tromsø|German Hefeweizen
49251|Baatbryggeriet Babord|Baatbryggeriet|6|3|6|3|15|3.3|Darkish brown in colour, smallish lacy head. Aroma is mostly malts. Taste is surprisingly light, mostly malts again, but with a slightly roast background. Very similar to the Nøgne Ø brown ale. Overall, a nicely drinkable and pleasant beer, if perhaps not too exciting. Probably a good way to introduce non-beer-geeks to quality beer.|7/26/2005 10:18:58 AM|Norway||Vestnes|Brown Ale
49252|Baatbryggeriet Styrbord|Baatbryggeriet|8|4|6|4|15|3.7|Golden colour, smallish, lacy head. Lovely aroma of what appears to be American hops. Taste is much like the aroma, but with an added crisp taste of malts. Reminds me of a lighter version of Goose Island IPA.  The overall impression is very nice indeed. Also very drinkable, so you can safely buy lots of this.|7/26/2005 10:16:44 AM|Norway||Vestnes|English Pale Ale
5942|Jämtlands Pilgrim|Jämtlands Bryggeri|6|3|6|3|12|3|Bottle. Best-before jan 2005, tasted july 2005. Medium off-white head, very dark red colour. Light roasted, hoppy nose. Subtle taste; some malts, some burntness, dry hoppy finish. A relatively light beer, taste-wise; unremarkable, but quite good.|7/1/2005 2:44:31 PM|Sweden||Pilgrimstad|English Pale Ale
5389|Martin's Pale Ale|John Martin (Scottish & Newcastle)|7|4|7|3|15|3.6|Dark orange, initially large creamy head, which quickly subsides. Nose like many pale ales, but fruitier. Taste full of malts, but with a fruity body, followed by a deliciously sharp, bitter aftertaste with hints of spice. Overall, very nice for an English pale ale; more taste than what is usual.|6/12/2005 1:03:05 PM|Belgium||Genval|English Strong Ale
44810|Nøgne Ø God Påske 2005-2006|Nøgne Ø|6|4|6|3|14|3.3|Bottled. Dark cloudy orange with a relatively small head. Vaguely citrusy and yeasty aroma. Slightly thin-bodied taste of yeast and wheat malts, yielding to a surprisingly bitter hop taste  with some sourness at the end. Unusual, somewhat interesting, and quite good.|3/15/2005 1:34:50 PM|Norway||Grimstad|Wheat Ale
11147|Hansa Påskebrygg|Hansa Borg Bryggerier|4|3|4|2|9|2.2|Canned. Bronze colour. Vague maltiness with slight bitterness. Not much taste, and in the end the bitterness dominates. Why they bother brewing this for easter is a mystery, really, given that the only thing that makes it stand out in any way at all is the bright yellow colour of the can.|2/26/2005 1:51:18 PM|Norway||Bergen|Pale Lager
814|Goose Island India Pale Ale|Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev)|8|3|8|4|17|4|Medium head, dark orange colour. Malty nose with powerful hop aroma. Dry malty, hoppy body, with both hops and malts lingering long into the aftertaste. Absolutely lovely! |2/18/2005 3:13:00 PM|United States|Illinois|Chicago|India Pale Ale (IPA)
28406|Wychwood Bah Humbug&#033; (Bottle)|Wychwood (Marstons plc)|7|4|7|4|15|3.7|Medium head, dark brown colour. Lovely sweet, malty smell of spice. Taste rather like the smell, with burnt notes and fruitiness. Aftertaste has slight hops bitterness, and more burntness. Very nice! No humbug about this one.|2/18/2005 2:16:03 PM|England|Oxfordshire|Witney|English Strong Ale
28509|Nøgne Ø India Pale Ale|Nøgne Ø|10|5|8|5|18|4.6|Cloudy orange, medium head. Enormous lovely hop aroma of citrus and flowers. Deep, powerful initial taste, followed by heavy bitterness that lingers. Fantastic! A beer to savour, and IMHO the best Norwegian beer currently available.|2/11/2005 7:33:23 AM|Norway||Grimstad|India Pale Ale (IPA)
41915|Nøgne Ø # 100 (Batch 100)|Nøgne Ø|8|5|7|5|17|4.2|(500 ml bottle, purchased in a pub after the owner learned I was interested in beer. Had it twice.)  Cloudy, dark orange, substantial head. Oily mouthfeel. Less aroma and taste than the Nøgne Ø IPA. Powerful, heavy taste, with substantial bitterness. The 80 IBU are quite well hidden, and overall I'm somewhat disappointed. I had enormous expectations for this beer after the Nøgne Ø IPA, so even if I was disappointed this remains a very good beer.|2/11/2005 7:28:14 AM|Norway||Grimstad|Barley Wine
